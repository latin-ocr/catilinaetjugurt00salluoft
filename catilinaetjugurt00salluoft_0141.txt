CHAPTER XLIX.

1. c. Piso] O. Calpurnius Piso, consul 687, proconsul of
the further Gaul 6883 defended by Cicero when accused of
extortion in his province. He is to be distinguished from L.
Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, consul A.U. 696, and father-in-law
ot' Cacsar, a great enemy of Cicero. Also from Μ. Pupius Piso,
and Cn. Calpurnius Piso, contemporary nobles. See above,
note on ch. is.

2. Neque precibus, etc] “Neither by entreaty, nor by the
offer of political favour and support, nor by direct bribery.”
The qratia or “support'' of the Optimates was of the utmost
consequence to Cicero atthis juncture, as was afterwards shown

the government of the oligarehy. But it is not likely that
' either of them was directly implicated. Caesar was named as
an accomplice the following year by L. Vettius, a man of bad
character, whose accusation would have been treated with con-
tempt, but that, being thrown into prison on another account
about the same time, he was found dead in his bed, which gave
occasion to odious suspicions,

4. Transpadani] An inhabitant of the part of the Cisal-
pine province beyond the Ι 0. Caesar was patron of this people,
and as such had impeached Piso.

5. Ex petitione pontificatus] Catulus had offered himself
as a candidate for the high-priesthood in the year 691, but was
opposed, much to his mortification, by Caesar, then compara-
