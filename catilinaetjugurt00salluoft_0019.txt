the Juyarcloa was certainly written after his pro-
vincial administration, in B.c. 463 and we can hardly
doubt therefore that Dion refers to the reflexions on
,13116 nobility at the beginning of 13116 Cutiliae, which
accordingly must have been written at an earlier
period. Thau the J ‘afflarcluo was written after B.c. 46,

the Punic books of king Hiempsal, which 116 consulted
for it, or rather which had been explained to him (see
J aqurtlza, ch. 17), indicating clearly that 116 was 111111-

The Catilina and ,haym-clia are what are denomi-

had composed an account of the wars of Marius and
Sulla, personal memoirs had been written by Rutilius
Rufus consul, B.C. 105, by AEmilius Scaurus, by Sulla
himself, and by Lucullus. Of Sisenna's work at least
the testimony both os Cicero and Sallust leaves us
little to regi-et 3 and it does not appear that the an-
cients themselves made much use of those of the
