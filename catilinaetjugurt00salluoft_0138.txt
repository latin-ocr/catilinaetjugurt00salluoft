106 SALL USTII CATILINA.

⁷ 3. Tarracinensem] “Os Tarracina,'’ or Anxur on the
coast of Latium, now Terracina.

h 4. Manu tenens] “Leading by the hand;'' as a mark of
ODOUI‘.

5. In aedem concordiae] The foundations of this temple
are still visible at the foot of the Capitoline hill, facing
the forum. It was built by Camillus, and commemorated
the restoration of concord between the senate and people.
Plutarch, Camill. 42. It was reconstructed by Tiberius and
his mother Livia A U. 765, perhaps after some intermediate
restoration or repair by L. Opimius, cons. A.u. (533. Plut.
G. Gracch. 17. The first ancl last of these occasions are
mentioned by Ovid, Fast. 1. 644.

Furius antiquum, populi superator Etrusci,
Vovcrat, ct voti solverat aute tidem.

Causa quod a patribus sumptis secesserat armis
Vulgus, et ipsa suas Roma timebat opeS.

Causa recens melior: passos Germania crines
l’orrigit auspiciis, dux venerande, tuiS.

6. Magna frequentia] “At a full meeting.” The senate
at this time amounted nominally to six hundred members;
but the vacancies caused by death had not been regularly
supplied by the censors. Four hundred and fifteen members
divided at a full meeting. Cic. ad Aac. i. 14. Comp. Cic. post‘
Red. in San. 10. Allowance must be made for the number of
senators engaged in the provincial administration. When
Cicero, Philipp. ii. 8, praises his own speeches, in hac cella
Concordiae, he refers to the temple itself, not to an inner shrine,
which could not have held any such meeting.

CHAPTER XLVII.

1. Alia] “Other than the truth;’' so the phrase, in alia
omnia abire, “to run off to matters others than those in hand,
not pertinent to the affair.’'

2. Fide publica] (Scil. data) “on the public saith being
pledged for his safety.” Comp. Catil. 48. se indicaturum si
fides publica data esset. Juyur. 32, 35.

3. Nihil amplius scire quam legatos] “That he knew no
more of the secrets of the plot than the Allobroges,” who as
foreigners could not be supposed intimate with its secret
objects and ramifications: in short, he professed to be an
instrument of the conspirators, but not an associate. He had
only heard the names of a few individuals among them. Kritz
explains it otherwise3 se praeterquam quod legatos sciat
conjurationis participes esse nullam plane ex conjuratis nosse:
and adds, nihil de personis dictum non insolens est.
