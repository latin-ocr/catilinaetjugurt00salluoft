CHAPTER V.

1. Varia victoria] Abl. case, as in sustin, iv. 2, diuque
varia victoria cum tyrannis dimicatum: “sometimes the Ro-
mans were victorious sometimes the Numidiam-P

2. Obviam itum est] ‘⁴ Was opposed.'’ Late writers used
a verb obviare, as Maerob. Sat. vii. 2, quibus obviandum non
erat.

3. Permiscuit] Comp. Lucan, iii. 138:

Non usque adeo permiscuit imis
Longus sumina dies, ut non si voce Metelli
serventur leges, malint a Caesare tolli.

4. Uti studiis civilibus, eta] “The vehemence of party
strife resulted in war and the desolation of Italy.'’ Lucan
seems to have referred to this passage when about to write of
Curio's African campaign. See Phars. iv. 687:

Nec tantum studiis civi‘ibzts arma parabat.

Privatae sed bella dabat Juba concitus irae.
Hune quoque quo superos humanaque polluit anno διο.

116 illius injuriam faciam illustrem.

7. Post magnitudinem, etc.] i.e. “no man injured Italy
So much, since the period when Rome had become powerful, as
Hannibal.⁷’ Before that period Pyrrhus and the Gauls, Italiae
opes attriverant. Comp. Catil. 5, 1111116 post dominationem L.
Sullae lubido maxima invaserat reip. capiendae: “ No man
had been so ambitious of power since the usurpation of Sulla-‘⁸'

S. cui postea Africano cognomen] P. Cornelius Scipio
received the surname Africanus for his victory over Hannibal at
Zama, and the triumphant conclusion of the second Punic war,
Α.11. 553 B.c. 201. He was said to be the first of the Romans
who received as his title the name of the country he had con-
quered. Sil. Ital. xvii. 627, Devictae primus referens cogno-

L. Aemilius Paulus, the conqueror of Macedonia, who became
