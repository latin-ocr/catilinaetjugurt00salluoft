Plaut. Capt. ii. 2. 96, nec quenquam fideliorem...Nec qui magis
sit servus ex sententia. A. Gell. iv. 20, quum censor dixisset:

appi-ove of,’' but “such as aceords or sympathises with you.''

CHAPTER CX.

1. Nunquam ego ratus sum] “I never should have
thought.'' For the English conjunctive the Latin idiom here
employs the indicative: comp. above, 11, quod verbum altius,
quam quisquam ratus erat, descendit. Cic. cle Off. i. 23, inge-
nii magni est, non committere ut aliquando dicendum sit, non
putaram, “ Ι should not have thought it.''

{orgia comicis usurpata Sallustio obtrudi non debet.’' Kritz

nullam patiere repulsam. Abeo is used, like discedo (comp.
Catil. 49, victus discesserat), for the event of an attempt or
contest. So Ovid, Metam. xiii. 278, eventus...pugnae Quis
fuit? Hector abit violatus vulnere nullo,

CHAPTER CXI.

1. Non in gratiam habituros] “ As for his promises,
they would not regard them as a means to deserve their favour,
since they had already got the upper hand in war.’‘ The accus

c. 112.
