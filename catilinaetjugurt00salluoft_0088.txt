56 SALLUSTII CATILINA.

maxime adtriverat, “more than any invader since the Roman
power had become great.''

9„ Sullae] Not Syllae, as appears from inscriptions, and
from the derivation of the word from sura.. The one form repre-
sents the Latin u, the other the Greek υ, which might be adopted
by a scribe who had a Greek text before him. Sulla composed his

own memoirs in Greek. The pronunciation would probably be
alike 111 either case.

10. Dum sibl regnum pararet]‘ ‘While he was bringing his
usurpation to effect.'’ Oomp. J ηραν. 31. regni paratio.

11. Quidquam pensi habebat] Comp. Catil. 12 23. 31.
Jzzgyur. 41 nihil pensi neque sancti habeie. Liv. xlii. 23.
pensum, i. q. perpensum, eonsiderwtmn

12. Diversa] “Contrary one to the other.'’

13. Supra repetere] “To trace from a higher source :⁷’
the object is instituta, or rather res Romanas generally, under-
stood in inst. maj. disserere ; “to disouss,'’ with or without an
accus. of the object. Comp. Cic. de Nat. Deor. iii. 40. ea dis-
serere malui. Tac. Αηη. 1. 4. bona libertatis disserere. This
passage involves both these constructions: scil. disserere ‘insti-
tuta, and disserere quomodo, etc.

CHAPTER VI.

1. Sicuti ego accepi] Implying that upon this point,
namely, the foundation of Rome itself, there were different
opinions. Tacitus commences his Arznczls with 1116 words,
Urbem Romam a principio reges habuere; as a matter upon
which there is no question.

2. Aborigines] Dionysius of Halicarnassus, in the last
century Β.0., 16 1116 first writer who mentions this tradition.
Misled perhaps by his imperfect acquaintance with Latin he
calls this people Ἀβερρίγενες ὥστε δηλοῦσθαι πλανήτας, from
whence Festus some centuries later, though spelling the name
correctly‚ repeats the absurd interpretation: Aborigines appellati
sunt quod errantes convenerint in agrum qui nuno est populi
Rom. Suidas again misspells it Ἀβωρίγενες. Α work of Varro
on the “Antiquities of Man ” bore the title Aboriyines.

3. Sine legibus, sine imperio] “Neither with a free
constitution, nor under authorized rule.''

4. Una moenia] Unus in plur. only joined with plural nouns3
as nuptiae, litterae, etc. Juyur. 60. unae atque alterae scalae.

5. Alius alio more viventes] Comp. Catil. 52. alius
alium expectantes. Jugyur. 53. alius alium appellant.
