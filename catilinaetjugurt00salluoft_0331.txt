and hesitation of his counsels. Comp. the shades of meaning
in the word in 0. 92 and again in 98.

2. Nullo impedimento] Priscian, vi. 7. 36, vetustissimi
solent omnium in -ius terminantium genitivum, etiam in -i
genitivum et in ·0 dativum proferre. Cic. pro Mur. 12 (if the
reading is correct), ei quoque carmen compositum est, quum
'ceteris rebus absurdum, tum vero 1111110 115111 utrisque. Caes.
B. G. ii. 7, nullo usui. Β. G. vi. 13, nullo concilio adhibetur.
But it may be the ablative in this place, as in Cic. ad Att. x.
18, majore impedimento fuerunt.''

3. Simul——et] “ No sooner—than.’' Comp. Tac. Arm. iv.
25, simul coeptus dies, et aderant in semisomnos,

4. Aut instrui aut sarcinas colligere] “Before the army
was arrayed for fighting, or had (even) put the baggage toge-
ther’' (as usual before action). Sarcina, the soldier’s pack or
huncne: Juvenal, ii. 103, speculum civilis sarcina belli.

5. Latrocinio... proelio] This opposition is frequently
emplrred. Comp. Liv. xxix. 6, latrociniis magis quam justo
bello gerebatur res. Cic. in Catil. i. 10.

6. Veteres (novique)] The last word should be put in
brackets as suspicious, though found in all the MSS„ except
one. It is explained, “the Romans being veterans and recruits,
and on ‘that account skflful in warfare‚’' i.e. because they were
not all reeruits. Sallust had used a similar combination, ch.
87, sic brevi spatio novi veteresque coaluere, et virtus omnium
aequalis facta: from which novique may have been foisted into
this passage.

CHAPTER XCVHI.

1. Manu consulere, etc.] “Since he could not aid his

verat.

2. Pro se] “In their own favour.’

3. Ex copia rerum consilium trahit] “Drawn out his
plans from the various resources before him ;” implying diffi-
culty os choice rather than hesitation.

4. Neque minus] i. q. non minus.- ‘neque properly is equi-
valent to et non ; but the copula is out of place here.
