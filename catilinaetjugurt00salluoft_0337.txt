NOTES 177

5. Ea res, ut in tali negotio, probata] “This course,
considering there was no better under the circumstances was
approved.⁷' Comp. Cic. acl Div. xii. 2, nonnihil, ut in tantis
malis, est profectum: de Senect. 4, multae erant in Q. Fabio,
ut in homine Romano, literae.

CHAPTER CVIII.

1. Orator] i. q. levatus, as frequently in Livy. Comp. i.
15; ii. 133 v. 15; xxxii. 173 xxxvii. 24, etc. Virg. Aen. vii.
153; viii. 505; xi. 100, 331.

2. consulta...integra habere] “That he had preserved
inviolate the covenant existing between them.’'

3. Neu Jugurthae legatum pertimesceret quo res commu-
nis licentius gereretur] Mezentius, i. q. liberius, “that Sulla
should not, through distrust of Jugurtha's envoy, Aspar, who
wasto be present, refrain from a free discussion with Dabar
about the affairs between himself and Bocchus.” If this is
the meaning‚sve should expect quin or ne instead of quo. But
it would be difficult to connect this sense with what follows.
Kritz’s conjecture, remoto after quo, gives the contrary sense,
and a much better one. Another conjectural reading is, n. J.
l. p.: cautum esse quo, ete. In any case the passage seems
corrupt.

4. Punica fide] “With Carthaginien bad saith? a pro-
verbial expression applied to the Moors-and Numidians as well
as to the actual Carthaginiens. Comp. Lucan, iv. 736, Ut
Libycas metuat fraudes infectaque semper Punica bella dolis.
For the proverbial bad saith attributed by the Romans to the
Carthaginians, see Livy, xxi. 43 xxv. 393 xlii. 47; Flor. ii. 2.
6; Val. Max. vii. 4. 4, etc. Plautus has the phrase, Poenis
Poenior. Sil. Ital. i. 5, sacri quum perfida pacti Gens Cadmea
super regno certamina movit. On the other hand, Attica
fides was an expression for good saith, Vell. ii. 23, adeo enim
certa Atheniensium in Romanos fides fuit ut semper, et in
omni re, quicquid sincera fide ageretur, id Romani Attica fieri
praedicarent. Ausonius, Epist. x. 47, contrasts Poena with
Graeca fides.

5. Attinuisse] “ Kept in play, amused or engaged. ” At-
tinere is commonly used in a moral sense. So Sallust, Fraq.
H ist. i. 19, ne nos in solitudine attineas. But by Tacitus fre-
quently for forcible detention: e.g. attineri in custodia.

CHAPTER CIX.

1. congressi] i. e. Sulla and Bocchus, who afterwards
retire to their respective camps, in sua castra.
