NOTES. 165

43. Decebat] The imperf. indic. follows the subjunc.
implying the certainty of the event which depends upon the
antecedent condition. “Even though all these things were
doubtful or distant, yet undoubtedly it is always fitting that
good men should succour the commonwealth.” Comp. Cic.
pro leq. Manil. 17, quod si Romae Cn. Pompeius privatus esset
,hoc tempore, tamen ad tantum bellum is erat diligendus atque
mittendus.

CHAPTER LXXXVI.

1. Non more majorum, neque ex classibus] Two parti· ’

culars are here mentioned in which Marius forsook the ancient
institution: instead of convening the people in the Campus
Martius, and calling them by their centuries for enlistment, he
allowed them to offer themselves indiscriminately-uti cujus—
que lubido erat—for service: and instead of selecting the sol-
diers exclusively from the five superior classes, arranged accord-
ing to their census, he enlisted most of his men from the sixth
or lowest of all, the membcrs of which, having no somnies,
were only polled, capite censi. This practice was continued in
later times, and the Roman soldiers, instead of having a stake
and interest in the institutions of the commonweasth, became
for the most part needy men, who served only for pay and
plunder. But the concentration of property in fewer hands,
and the diminution of the class of small proprietors, ren-

dered th9is course of proceeding imperative. Comp. Plutarch.
⁶ αν. c. .

f 2.b Inopia bonorum] “For want of good men‚'’ i.e. men
ο su stance.

3. Auctus] “Advanced,’' i.e. in power, fame, or honours.

4. Et homini, ete] A new clause, not dependent upon the
preceding quod, but expressing the writer's own judgment ou
Marius's motives.

5. Neque sua cusae] i. q. et sua non curae.

3. Futuros] · For this pregnant combination of the adverb
with the verb, compare Jufflcr. 7, frustra erat. 14, tutius essem:
and other places noticed above. Laxius refers to their disci-
pline, licenti zcs to their behaviour.
