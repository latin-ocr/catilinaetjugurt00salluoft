CHAPTER XXXIX.

1. Ad bellum maritimum atque Mithridaticum] The
“maritime war'’ was that against the Ciliciam pirates, who
infested the whole of the Mediterranean, and often madz¹
'descents on land, even in Italy. Gabinius, a creature os
Pompey, proposed a law sor conferring upon him extraordi-
nary command for their suppression, A„ U. 687. The speed
and efficiency with which Pompey put down these marauders was
deservedly celebrated. See Cic. pro lay. Manil. 12, Plutarch,
Pomp. 24, and the historians Appian, Florus, and Velleius
PaterculuS.

The ‘⁴ Mithridatio war ’' was the long contest waged by the
republic against Mithridates, the renowned king of Pontus,
Sulla had defeated, and was supposed to have crushed him;
but he rose again, and wrested the province of Asia from the
Romans. Lucullus again defeated him, but he was still un-
conquered 3 and at last, at the motion of Manilius, the Roman
people appointed Ponipey to carry on the war against him,
with full powers throughout the eastern possessions of the
republic. This extraordinary commission was regarded by the
senate with great jealousy. It was apprehended that Pompey
would never consent to return to Rome as a private man.
Nevertheless, after the successful completion of his task, and
the addition of extensive provinces to the empire, he disbanded
his legions, and was content to be the first citizen in the free
state. But he afterwards repented, and tried, by a league with
Caesar and Crassus, (the first triumvirate‚) to acquire a more
decided supremae-y in the comnionwealth. The Manilian law
was carried Α. U. 688.

2. Plebis opes imminutae] ‘¹ The power of the commone
was curtailed.” During Pompey’s absence the nobles strove
to recover their ascendancy, which he had considerably reduced
in his consulship, A. U. 684.

3. Innoxii] Passive, “secure from attacks Comp. Lucan,
ix. 891 :
Gens unica terras
Incolit a saevo serpentum innoxia morsu.

ColumeHa‚ v. 9. innoxius ab injuria pecorum.

4. ceteros] Comp. e. 51: juxta bonos et malos lubidinose
interficere, ceteros metu terrere.

5. Quo plebem etc.] There is great confusion in this
passage. Understand hi, the nobility, both patrician and
plebeiam ipsi, ‚such of them as actually occupied the public
