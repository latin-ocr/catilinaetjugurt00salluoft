 

NOTES. 163

1233 Vos existimate] Emphatic: “judge ye for your—
se ves.'

24. Fortissimum quemque generosiss] Comp. Juvenal,
viii. 20, nobilitas sola est atque unica w'rtus.

25. vestros honores] “The honours you have to bestow.”

' 26. Ita hos petunt] “So seek the same,'’ i.e. your ho-
nours.

27. Falsi sunt] “Are deceived.'‘

28. Posteris lumen] Many MSS. read quasi lumem and
this particle is frequently inserted, to soften the harshness of
a metaphor: as Cic. de Off. ii. 9, honestum decorumque quasi
perlucet ex iis quas commemoravi virtutibus.

29. 111 conscientiam duceret] “Construe into a consci-
ousness of guilt.'' Comp. above, ch. 82, in superbiam vertebant.
92, in virtutem trahebantur.

30. Ex animi mei sententia] The pronoun, omitted in
many MSS„ seems to be required in solemn asseverations of
thjs kind. Comp. Cic. de Off. ni. 29, quod ex animi tm· senten-
tia juraris, sicut verbis concipitur more nostro, id non facere
perjurium est. And A. Gell. iv. 20, verba ita erant concepta ut
tu ex animi tui sententia uxorem habes.

31. fidei causa] Scil. dandae, “ in confirmation of what I
say.’'

32. Hastae, vexillum, phaleras] The hasta was presented
to deserving soldiers (Festus in voc.,) and was called pura, as
having no iron head. The vexillum was a streamer at the end
of a spear· phalerae, trappings for horses: the alia dona mili-
taria were torques and catellae, chains, armzllae, bracelets, fi-bu
lae, clasps‚ coronae, crowns or chaplets of vaiious kinds. Most
of ’these are enumeiated among the trophies of Siccius Denta-
tus, by A. Gellius, ii. 11. Comp. Juvenal, xvi. ult„ laeti pha-
leris omnes et torquibus omnes.

33. Neque literas Graecas didici] Plutarch, who has
made much use of this oration in describing the character of
Marius, repeats that he despised the manners and literature of
the Greeks on the account here mentioned, that they did not
save that people from conquest by the Romans, and imputes
to this morose pride much of the barbarity of his actions. ὤσ-
