N OTES. 123

3. Pollens] “ Effective.’' An epithet frequently applied
by the later writers to language, as Lucan, vi. 685:

Tunc vox Lethaeos cunctis pollentior herbis
Excantare Deos.

Claud. vi. Gons. Honor. 501, quanta tuis facundia pollet In-
genus.

4. Perscribere] It has been inferred from this word that
the author has in this instance transcribed a genuine speech,
instead of making one of his own invention. Some critics have
fancied accordingly that the style is quite different from
Sallust’s own. Ι cannot perceive any material difference; the
words are evidently Sauust’s, and the most that can be reason-
ably said, is that the substance may be derived from the
genuine document.

CHAPTER XXXI.

1. Α vobis] i. e. ne rerum vestrarum curam suscipiam.
This seems to be imitated from a speech of Cato the censor, cle
Lusitania a fragment of which is preserved in A. Gellius, xiii.
24, multa me dehortata sunt huc prodire, anni, aetas, vox,
vires, senectus.

2.l fstudium reip] Comp. Catil. 41, studium conjurationis3
‘⁴ zea or.'

3. His annis xv.] “For these last fifteen years.'' The
number is perhaps corrupt. The MSS. fluctuate between xv.
xii. and x. It was twenty-two years from the death of Tib.
Gracchus, ten years from that of Caius, either of which epochs
might be pointed to. Cortius conjectures xx. as a round num-
ber, which Kritz and Dietsch adopt. Gerlach retains xv.

4. Vestri defensores] Scil. the Gracchi.

5. obnoxiis inimicis] “When your foes have fallen into
your hands:'⁷ i.e. their guilt is detected, and they are unable
to palliate it. Comp. the use of obnoxius in Catil. 20, 48.
Liv. xxiii. 12, si reticeam aut superbus aut obnoxius videar,
“if Ι keep silence Ι shall seem either to be proud or conscious
of guilt.’' Dietsch in loc. “gravissime orator perstringit popu-
larium socordiam, qui omnibus injuriis vexati, ne tum quidem
ad strenue agendum parati crant, quum certam victoriam in
manibus haberent.''

6. Experiar] “I will make trial of.'' Liv. xxxix. 26,
licentiam vocis et linguae experiri. Plin. Paney. 67, libertatem
quam dedit experiemur. Juvenal i. extr.
