xiv INTROD UGTION.

harangues addressed to Julius Caesar, and entitled
Epistolce de republica ordinanda, have also been
ascribed to Sallust, but their authenticity is very
questionable.

The Catilina, or Bellum Catilinarium, is a history
of the conspiiacy of Catilina, Rc. 63. It contains in
itself no distinct evidence of the date of its compo-

J erome (in Jovin. i. p. 52) that the author married
Terentia, presume that subsequently to his marriage
he would not have alluded to the disgrace of Terentia's
sister, the Vestal Virgin whom Catilina was accusez]
of seducing (see Catil. ch. 15). But as both the date
and fact of the marriage are quite uncertain, such a

the period of this composition. Others again contend
that Sallust would not have invented a speech for
Caesar (Catil. ch. 51), instead of giving the genuine
oration, during Oaesar's actual lifetime, and therefore
argue that the work must have been written as late as
nc. 44, the year of Caesarâ€™s death. There can be no
force, however, in this argument to those who know
the indifference of Sallust, and of the ancients in
general, to the authenticity of such rhetorical exer-
cises as the harangues with which they studied to
adorn their narratives. On the other hand, we have
to set Dion's remarks about the inconsistency observed
at the time between Sallust's conduct in his province,

and the sentiments declared in his writings. Now
