4. Massiliam 111 exilium] Comp. Cicero, in Catil. 11. 6.
Massilia, the modern Marseines, was founded by the Phocaeans
(Thucyd. 1. 13) 011 the south coast of Gaul, about 600 B.e.‚
and became celebrated for its commerce and civilization.
When the Romans gained a footing on the further side of the
Alps, they formed an alliance with Massilia, and allowed. it to
retain a nominal independence and sovereignty over a small
district on the coast. The Roman province being governed by
prooonsuls sent there by the oligarehieal party, and. all their
influence brought to bear upon the allies of the republic,
Massilia became firmly attached to the senate; and Catiline,
in pretending to choose it for his place of exile, intimated that.
he was falsely accused of hostility to the ruling faction. Exile
among the Romans was banishment to a place beyond the
direct control of the commonwealth, but any allied city was
allowed to receive exiles, however near it might be to Rome.
Gradually all the free states were absorbed into the provinces,
and there ceased to be any place of asylum for exiles within.
the frontiers of the empire.
