5. Vestrum] The passage was thus read by A. Gellius
(xx. 6), though many MSS. give vestri. Observe that nostri,
vestri are genitives sing. of the possessives noster, vester, not
genitives plural of nos, vOS, as the grammars for the most part
assert. In partition nostrum must be used, as primus nostrum,
multi nostrum, not nostri. On the other hand, amor nostri,
where “being or condition,” neyotii, may be understood. So
where nos is the subject, pars nostrum amat.- but vivas memor
nostri, noster being the object.

7. Argentum aere solutum est] The sih-er coin, the

second Punic war it was made = 4 asses. See Plin. Hist. Nat.

unciales facti, placuitque denarium sedecim assibus permutari, .
sestertium quaternis, The weight of the as was gradually
reduced from its original 12 ounces to 13 and the denarius,
properly ten asseS‚ was made = sixteen, the sestertius=four
asses.

8. secessit] On three or more occasions the plebs re-
moved in a body from the city. See Livy, ii. 32 (A. U. 260); iii.
50 (1211. 305); Epic. xi. (mu. 466); Sallust, Juyur. 31, speaks
of two secessions to the Aventine. They were prevailed upon
to return by concessions accorded them by the patricians.

9. Amittit] “Parts with;‘’ amittere, to let a thing be
taken from one, perdere, to throw it away.

tion. “Marcius said, If they wished to make any suit to the
senate, let them lay down their armS.'’ Comp. c. 32. quibus
rebus possent opes factionis confirment.

2. Ab armis discedant] i. e. a bello, “abandon their
hostile attitudc.’'
