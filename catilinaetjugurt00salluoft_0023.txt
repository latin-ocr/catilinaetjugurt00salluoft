INTROD UOTJON. xix

marians, and their reading of them is of course entitled
to careful consideration.

The text given by Gerlach in his last edition, Ber-
. lin, 1852, very nearly corresponds, at last, after much
fluctuation of opinion, with that of Kritz, Leipsic,
1828—1834, and, with the exceptions indicated above
adopted for the convenience of the young reader, I
shall be found to agree, I believe, in almost every case

either with one or the other of these eminent critics.

In two or three places Ι have ventured to omit a -

gross expression, a course which for my own part
I could wish to see more extensively adopted in an
age when the reading of Latin is becoming almost as
common among women of polished education as in the
good old times of J ane Grey and Elizabeth.

The annotations here offered to the student have
been principally drawn from the variorum notes of
Havercamp's edition, from Gerlach, and from Kritz.
Much novelty of illustration is hardly to be expected
upon a subject which has been so repeatedly treated,
and most of the editors have done little more in this
respect than copy from one another. The edition of
Kritz however, which is mainly devoted to an exami-
nation of the anthor's grammatica] constructione, is
distinguished by great originality of research. I have
appended liis name only to a few of the notes 3 but
my obligation to his learning and acumen· are mani—
sold throughout. Some use has also been made of
the recent edition by Dietsch, which has only reached
me while these sheets were printing.
