N OTES. 103

2. constituerant] The plur. supported by many of the
best Mss. is referred irregularly to Lentulus cum ceteris, as
though it were Lentulus ceterique. Comp. Juffur. 101. Bocchus
cum peditibUS...inva<lunt. Liv. xxi. 60. ipse dux cum principi-
bus capiuntur.

3. De actionibus ciceronis] “Of the actions, i. e. con-
duct of Cicero.⁷' Actiones in the plur. is rare in this sense.
Comp. Cic. de Off. ii. 1. actiones suas scriptis mandare. It is
generally used technically of legal proceedings. It was the
policy of the conspirators to pretend that Cicero had got up
a false rumour of a plot in order to drive innocent men away
from the city. Comp. Appian, Bell. Giv. ii. 3. Λεύκιον δὲ Βηστίαν
τὸν δήμαρχον ἐκκλησίαν εὐθὺς ὑπὸ κήρυξι συνάγειν, καὶ κατηγορεῖν
τοῦ Κικέρωνος, ὡς ἀεὶ δειλοῦ καὶ πολεμοποιοῦ, καὶ τὴν πόλιν ἐν
οὐδενὶ δεινῷ διαταράσσοντος.

4. optimo consuli] It seems that M. Brutus in writing
an account of these transactions used this same expression,
optemus consul, with reference to Cicero⁷s part in them. Cicero
in a letter to Atticus, xii. 21, complains of the account as
calculated to exalt Cato’s conduct in comparison with his own,
and refers to this phrase as disparaging. Hic autem se etiam
tribuere multum mihi putat, quod scripserit optimum consu-
lem. It is probable, from the character of his mind, that
Brutus was very cold and measured in his laudatiori of the con-
sul, and in his mouth the word optimus might have a formal
and pedantic sound. But I do not think Sallust meant
anything depreciatory. Optimus was itself a hearty and genial
word, and occurs in the most complimentary descriptions.
Juvenal, x. 331. optimus hic et formosissimus idem Gentis
patriciae. Cicero himself uses it of Pansa; consul fortissimus
atque optimus. Philipp. vii. 2,

5. Eo signo proxima nocte] “The night after that signal
should be given.” There is no need to insert clato, as in some
MSS. and editt. Plutarch says that the night fixed was one of
the Saturnalia, which commenced with the 17th of December.
The tribunes were to enter upon their office the lOth of that
mouth. But Cicero’s vigilance anticipated. this design. He
got the conspirators executed December 5.

6. cetera multitudo coniurationis] “All the rest of the con-
spirators.'’ Exsequeretar in the sing. (the reading of the MSS.)
refers to quisque, not to multitudo. Comp. Cic. de Off. i. 41. et
vero etiam poetae suum quisque opus a vulgo considerari vult.

7. Duodecim simul] Plutarch doubtless exaggerates when
he says that the conspirators assigned a hundred different
places to be fired at the same time.
