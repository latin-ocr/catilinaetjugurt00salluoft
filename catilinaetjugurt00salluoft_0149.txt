34. Insignia magistratuum] Such, perhapS, as the trabea,
or white robe bordered or striped with purple, worn by the
consuls and other magistrates; the curule chair, the fasces,
and the lictors.

35. Bonis] Scil. institutis. The dative of the thing,
instead of the person, which is inore usual with invidere.

36. Graeciae morem] The Romans were proud of the
mildness of their laws in regard to their own citizens, which

inflicted on slight grounds though the mode of death, by

undertake the confinement of these prisonem. Cicero says:
municipiis dispertiri jubet. Habere videtur ista res iniquita-
tem, si imperare velis; difficultatem, si rogas

41. cum populo agat] ⁵‘Transact business with the
