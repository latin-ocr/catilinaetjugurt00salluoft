as Sil. Ital. xii. 196, stat campus et arma, Et Mars in manibus,
and Lucan, vii. 253, In manibus vestris, quantus sit Caesar,
habetis, rather mean ⁴⁴ in your power to use.’'

CHAPTER LVIII.

1. Portam irrumpit] For ‘in portam irr. This poetica]
usage is affected by Sallust, comp. εΙιιῃιιγ. 25; aud imitated by
Tacitus (Anu. i. 483 ii. 62. Hist. i. 61; iii. 47; iv. 15, 50, eto.).

2. Nominis Romani] “Of the fame of Rome.” Comp.
Livy iv. 33, nominis Romani ao w’rtutis patrum vestraeque
memores. Lucan, xiii. 798, Romanum nomen et omne Im-
perium Magno est tumuli moduS.

3. Pauci in pluribus minus frustrati] “Being few in
number, and therefore sparse in array, while the enemy being
more numerous were more densely posted, they missed their
aim less frequently of the two.” Istrus-traci, passive.

4. Propere statim] “ Quickly immediately.'' The
cavalry are sent speedily‚ Marius himself immediately, without
a moment’s delay.

CHAPTER LIX.

1. In proximo] Seii. loeo, “nearest to the enemy.'

2. Quivissent...facerent] The imperf. does not stand for
the plusq. perfi, but indicates that the slaughter was still
in progress when the Numidians had already been enabled to
maintain their ground. Comp. Florus, iii. 3, 13, Cimbri si
statim infesto agmine urbem petissent, grande discrimen esset:
i.e. the Cimbri did not attaek the city immediately, and
accordingly the danger which was impending became averted.
Cic. Brut. 10, neque enim jam Troicis temporibus tantum
laudis in dicendo Ulixi tribuisset HomeruS...nisi jam tum
esset honos eloquentiae; i. e. great honour was already paid
to eloquence at the time when Homer so praised Ulysses.
Kritz in loc.

3. Pedites cum equitibus permixti] Of this mode of
fighting among the Numidians, we read in Auct. de Bell. Afric.
69, Numidae...mirabi]j velocitate praediti, qui inter equites
pugnabant. Caesar himself introduced this practice into his
own legions.

4. victos dare] i. q. vincere: an antique or poetical usage.
It occurs frequently in Plautus. Comp. Liv. viii. 6, sic stratas
legiones Latinorum dabo. Virg. Aen. xii. 437, nunc te mea
dextera bello Defensum dabit. Aen. xi. 334, quando tot stragis
acervos Teucrorum tua dextra dedit. So also dicta dare for
dicere.
