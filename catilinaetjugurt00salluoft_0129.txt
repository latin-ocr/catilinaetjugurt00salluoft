N OTES. 97.

11. Mannum mercede] “With the wages of manual
labour.'’ Comp. Vir-g. Aen. viii. 400. Cui tolerare colo vitam

tenuique Minerva.

12. Privatis atque publicis largitionibus] i.e. distribu-
tions of corn, oil, or wine, made by rich patrous to their clients3
or by candidates for office, or actual magistrates, to the people.
Thus Crassus, after the defeat of Spartacus, when suing for
the consulship, ΑΛ). 683, feasted the Roman people at ten
thousand tables. Public lareesses had been given occasionally,
and C. Gracchus introduced the sale of corn at low fixed prices
to the citizen& but M. Cato first advised a regular gratuitous
distribution, in the hope of withdrawing the needy citizens
from the influence of the demagogues. The largess (five
bushels, Sall. Fr. H ist.) was given monthly, Suet. Oct. 40.

13. Praetulerat] Depending upon quae, as toleraverat.

14. Eos] Scil. juvenes, understood in juventus: the con-
struction is broken,juvcnt¹zcs being a nomin. absolute.

15. Juxta] “Not more for the advantage of the one than
the other, but equally ill sor both.” Coinp. Catil. 61. ita cuncti
suae atque hostium vitae juxta pepercerant.

16. Jus libertatis imminutum] “ Treated as if they were
neither citizens nor freemen‚’' i. e. deprived of the privileges of
the constitution. The families of the proscribed were incapaci-
tated sor holding public office by a Lex Cornelia, A.U. 673.
Vell. ii. 28. exclusique paternis opibus liberi etiam petendorum
honorum jure prohiberentur, simulque quod indignissimum
est, senatorum filii et onera ordinis sustinerent et jura per-
derent. The rehabilitation of these persons was agitated for
many years; defeated by Cicero in his consulship3 and at
last effected by Caesar as dictator. See Plutarch, Caes. 37 (A. U.
705) ; Suet. Jul. 75.

17. Aliarum atque senati] Atque and ac are used after
words of comparison, e. g. idem. pars, simslis, alius, aeque, per-
inde, aliter, secus,· where the sense can only be rendered in
English by ‘⁶ a3‚’' or “tham'' Ut, however, sometimes occurs
with atque, as Cic. in Verr. i. 46. aliter atque ut edixerat3
from which it may be surmised that the copula of comparison
has dropped out of the idiom3 and that atque had originally
its proper sense of ‘⁴ immediately‚’² “just ;” e. g. hic jacit idem
acque (quod) esso, “he does just the same as I do.'’

18. Id adeo malum] Emphatic, ‘⁸ that evil, then ;” or
“that evil, great as it was :” namely, the inveterate jealousy of
the commone towards the senate, dating at least from the times
of the Gracchi sixty or sevcnty years before.
