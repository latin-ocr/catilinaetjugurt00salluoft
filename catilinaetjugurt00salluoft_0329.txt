CHAPTER XCV.

1. Quos] Referring to equites, understood in equitatus.

2. Ex Latio] i.e. from the socii Latini nominis, such Ita-
lian towns as had the Latin franchise.

3. L. Sisenna] This historian, one of the Cornelian gens,
and partia] perhaps on that account to Sulla, wrote a history
of the social war and the civil wars of Sulla and Marius, He
was born about 118 Bo, and was praetor in 78, the year in
which Sulla died. Cicero speaks of him. de Lea. i. 2, Brut. 76,
and esteemed him superior as an historian to his predecessors.
About 150 fragments of his great work are preserved, but very
short and unconnected.

4. Familia prope „iam extincta] So Velleius, ii. 17, says
of him; L. Corn. Sulla natus familia nobili, sextus a Cornelio
Rufino, qui bello Pyrrhi inter celeberrimos fuerat duces, quum
familiae ejus claritudo intermissa esset, diu ita se gessit, ut
nullam petendi consulatum cogitationem habere videretur.
Sallust speaks of the familia of the Sullae, a branch of the
Rufini. The Cornelii were a numerous and distinguished
qens in early times, and were subdivided into several familiae,
eg. patriciam: Arvina, Blasio, Cethegus, Cinna, Cossus, Dola-
bella, Lentulus, Maluginensis Mammula, Merenda, Merula,
Rufinus, Scapula, Scipio, Sisenna, Sulla. Of these the Len-
tuli and Scipios had various aynomeus, distinguishing indivi-
dunis. The plebeian Cornelii were Galli and Balbi. Sulla
introduced a vast number of his own clients and dependents
into the Corneliam gens, and under the empire it was un-
doubtedly the most extensive os all the Roman houses.

5. Otio luxurioso esse] Sub coepit, i. q. erat, “ debauched
in his intem-als of leisure.'' The gross debauchery imputed to
Sulla (but we must remember how many enemies he had made)
is painted in strong colours by Plutarch in his life. He was
said to have died of a loathsome disease brought on, we may
suppose, by intemperance.

6. Nisi quod] Complete the sentence thus: nisi huic
laudi repzcssnat quod. Comp. Tac. Απη. i. 33, ipsa Agrippina
paulo commotior, nisi quod castitate...indomitum animum in
bonum trahebat, i.e. quae res non poterat non damnosa fieri
