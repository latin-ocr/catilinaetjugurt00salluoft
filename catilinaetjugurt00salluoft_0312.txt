2. Amplius...posse] More usually, plus posse. But comp.
J ηραν. 111, quoniam armis amplius valuissent.

3. Ex perfidia] “ Since the day of their ‘treachery” For
this sense of em, see above, c. 36.

4. opulens] Sallust uses the common form, opulentus, in
Catil. 53, ιῙιιῃιιν. 10, 75, and elsewhere; but opulenter, Juyur.
s5. So violens in Horat. Carm. iii. 30, Dicar qua violens ob-
strepit Aufidus

5. Poenae...aut praedae fuit] “Was subJ'ected to pun-
ishment, i.e. massacre, 01· plunder.'’ Poenae esse could hardly
be admissible by itself, but the meaning is understood from
praedae esse.

7. Nam is civis ex Latio erat] “For he was a citizen of the
Latin rank or order;” i. e. only had the Latin franchise. By
the lex Porcia a genuine Roman citizen might not bc beaten
with rods. This exemption had been extended to the Latins
by a lex of M. Livius Drusus, AJJ. 632, Plut. C. Grneclz. 9, but
seems to have been disregarded. The story of Turpilius is
told somewhat differently by Plutarch, Mar. 8. According to
this writer the charge against him was false, and got up by
Marius, who instigated Metellus to put him to death to gratify

his own malice against the imperator, whose retainer Turpilius
had been.

2. Omnia tentando] This is to be distinguished from
omnia tentans ‘⁴ in the course of trying everything,’' and from
omnibus tentatis, “after everything had been tried.'’ It im-
plies that what follows, socium sibi adjungit N., was a result
of his trying various schemeS.

3. majoribus adstricto] scil. rebus. “Occupied by more
important affairs.”

4. Quae superaverant] i. q. restiterant, superfuerant,
