fashion of teaching young women the soft Ionian dances. Motus
doceri gaudet Ionicos Matura virgo, et fingitur artubus. Carm.
iii. 6. 26. Sallust by the word necesse seems to admit that the
practice was tolerated in his time, but regarded with jealousy.
Probae : i. q. pudicae. Hor. Epocl, 17. 40. tu pudica, tu proba.
If there is any distinction proba may refer to manners, pudica
to morals, as in Sall. Fr. Hist. oris probi, animi inverecundi.

7. Multa alia] The ablat. litteris, the infin. psallere,
alnidlgllieuacc. alia, seem all to depend upon docta, “taught or

8. Instrumenta luxuriae] “The means of corruption,'’
or ‘⁴ vice.''

9. Decus] “Good name, honour.'’ Comp. Juqur. 4.
decus atque libertatem gratificari.

10. ruit] Many MSS. read suere; which is an attempt to
correct a supposed incorrectness in the construction ot' the
sense. The sing. suit is defended by Juyur. 18. ea loca quae
proxime Carthaginem Numidia appellatur, not appellantur.
Ovid, Art. Am. iii. 222. Quas geritis vestes sordida lana fuit.

Quum te jam multi peterent tu me una petisti. Senec. Medea,
218. petebant tunc meos thalamos proci, Qui nunc petuntur.

13. Creditum abjuraverat] “ Had forsworn a trust.''
Among the Romans, the absence of facilities for bartering and
exchange rendered it necessary to keep hoards of gold and
silver, and these it was often requisite to entrust to the care of
friends. The facility of breaking such engagements caused
their faithful fulfilment to be regarded as an eminent virtue.
Comp. Juvenal, xiii. 60 :

Nunc si depositum non infitietur amicus.

Si reddat veterem cum tota aerugine follem,
Prodigiosa fides ct Tuscis digna libellis,
Quaeque coronata lustrari debeat agna.

praeceps ire, ‘⁵ to fall headlong ;'⁷ but abire, ‘⁴ to stray from the

with praeceps in its ordinary sense in Livy, xli. 10. praeceps in
provinciam abiit.
