104 SALLUSTJI CATILINA.

8. Filii familiarum] Catilina’s adherents were mostly
young men. Cicero calls them, libidinosa et delicata juventus
(ad Aa. i. 19); sanguinaria juventus (ad Ate. ii. 7). Comp. in
Catil. ii. 3. hos quos volitare in foro, quos stare ad curiam,
quos etiam in senatum venire, qui nitent unguentis, qui fulgent
purpura. Of the proscriptions of the second triumvirate Velleius
remarks: Id tamen notandum, fuisse in proscriptos uxorum
fidem summam, libertorum mediam, servorum aliquam,
filiorum nullam. ii. 67. Appiam, however, affirms that many
Roman matrons helped Catiline with money in the hope that
he would exterminate thcir husbands. Bell. Civ. ii. 2.

9. Dies prolatando] “By putting off the days fixed for
the enterprise.’‘ Tac. Αηη. vi. 42. diem ex die prolatare.
Prolatare, an intensive form, from proferre, prolatum.

CHAPTER XLIV.

l1. ceteros conveniunt] “Have an interview with the
ot iers.”

ss} ³ Postulant jusjurandum] “Demand a written form of
oa .’

3. Signatum] “With the seals of the parties affixed.”
4. Aliter] i. q. alioquin, “unless they did s0.''
5. crotoniensem] “A citizen of Crotona‚'' in Bruttium.

6. Quis sim] Some MSS. read qui sim. Quis sim, means,
“who Ι am;'⁷ qui sim. “what sort of person I am.'’ So Cic.
in Caec. Div. 12. qui sis et quid facere possis, considera. Liv.
i. 41. qui sis, non unde natus sis, reputa.

7. Etiam ab infimis] This was a covert suggestion to
arm slaves, which was too atrocious a design to be committed
to writing‚ though recommended, as we see immediately after-
wards, orally. Comp. the same letter recited, with some
variation, by Cicero, in Cutil. iii. 5. Probably neither author
cared to quote with perfect accuracy. No reliance whatever

van be placed on Sallust saying just above, quarum exemplum
iufra scriptum.

8. Quo consilio servitia repudiet 7] “What would be the
sense of rejecting the employment of slaves?”

CHAPTER XLV.

1. 1.. va1erio Flacco] The same whom Cicero defended
upon a charge of malversation in the province of Asia.
