medium montis. This usage is common in Tacitus: medio
campo, medio montium et paludum. So Livy: extremo aestatis3
extremum auctumni. The more correct idiom would be in ex-
tremo monte.

4. cupidine caecus] Comp. Lucan, i. 87:

O male concordes nimiaque cupidine caeci.

5. vineas agere] “ To thrust mantletssorward.” A mili-
tary phrase adopted more than once by Caesar.

6. Aggerem jacere] ‘⁴ Throw up a mound.⁷' More com-
ffigfilgu'gaoere fundamenta, to lay down, Horat. jactis in altum

7. Incepto] ‘⁴ For his enterprise.’'

8. Properare] This reading preferable to praeparare. So
J ηραν. 77, ni id festinaret.

CHAPTER XXXVIII.

1. subdolus augere] The adJ'ective is used in place of the
adverb subdole, which indeed is found in some MSS. Comp.
Catil. 60, illi haud tinzidi resistunt; for timide. Juyur. 44,
praedas certantes agere. 61, effecit uti ad se occultus veniat.

2. Missltare] “To send frequently.” A word which only
ἓὲοῐιέξει in Liv. ix. 4, and Plin. H isc. Nat. xxxiii. 1. Dietsch

3. vitabundus] “Constantly avoidjngff’ The participial
in bundas implies the force, frequency, or abundance of an
action. It is generally formed from intransitive verbs. Here
the verb is transitive, and Livy uses the phrase vitabundus
castra, xxv. 13. Madvig, Latin Grammar, 115.

4. Delicta] Referring to pactio, Jugurtha enticed Aulus
into a remote place, where he might come to an understanding
with the enemy undiscovered. But thc passage seems to be
corrupt, to judge from the variation of the MSS„ and some
editors have tried to make better sense of it by transferring it to
another place, e.g. after desererent.

5. Instruit] The present after postquam, frequent in Sal-
lust, to give rapidity to the narrative. Comp. Catil. 40. 573
Juyzcr. 66, 76, 79, 80, 84, 86.

6. Periculum anceps] “The danger was double, whether
'they remained or fled,⁷⁷ i.e. from the attack of the enemy, and
from the darkness of the night3 as explained by the words
which follow. Anceps, i. e. ambiceps, “that can be taken up
on either side; ‘' hence may mean “ double’' or ‘⁸ doubtful.'’
