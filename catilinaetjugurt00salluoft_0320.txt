160 SALLUSTJI JUGURTHA.

CHAPTER LXXXIII.

1. sumi facile] Comp. Tacit. Hist. iv. 69, suini bellum
etiam ab ignavis, strenuissimi cujusque periculo geri.

2. conventura] “Would be settled amicably.” Things
are said convenire when both parties agree about them: so,
pax convenit. Liv. xxiv. 27, Marcellus posse rem convenire
ratus.

3. Contra] “In reply t0.⁷⁷

4. Bellum intactum trahi] “The war was protmcted,
and nothing ds›ne.'’ Bellum trahi is a common phrase3 but
intactum. is added per oaeymomm; being a contradiction in
sense for the sake of emphasis. “The war was protracted,
or indeed not even commenced.'’

CHAPTER LXXXIV.

1. cupientissima plebe] i. q. optime cupiente, “with the
warmest approbation of the commonalty.⁷⁷

2. Ei provinciam Numid. populus jussit] i.e. decrevit.
Jubere, with the accus. of the object, expresses a decree of the
people in the coniitia. Cic. pro Balb. 17, responderem legem
populum Rom. jussisse. Liv. xxi. 17, quod bellum populus
Rom. jussisset. The person in whose interest the decree is
made is in the dative.

3. Populus] “The Roman people,” comprehending all
classes, ancl opposed to plebs, “the commonalty.’' Populus,
according to Niebuhr, is properly the patriciali class, opposed
to the plebeian; but this correct usage was neglected by the
best authors, and perhaps they were not fully aware of it.

4. Multus...instare] Comp. the Greek phrase in Thuc.
iv. 22, Κλέων δὲ ἐνταῦθα δὴ πολὺς ἐνέκειτο.

5. Illis dolentia] i.e. quae illc· dolerent, or dolorem qffer-
rent, “causing pain.³⁷ Comp. Ovid‚ Met. iv. 246, nil illo fertur
...vidisse dolentius. So vulnus dolet, i.e. dolorem facit.

6. Plerosque militiae, paucos fama cognitos] “Most of
them known to him in actual service, a few only by report ; ”
militiae is the genitive of place, like domi, and is equivalent to
soris, as those who serve in the army serve abroad. The dou-
ble construction with the sanie verb is found elsewhere in Sal
lust: as Catil. 33, plerique patriae sed omnes fama atque for-
tunis expertes. Comp. J nour. 74.
