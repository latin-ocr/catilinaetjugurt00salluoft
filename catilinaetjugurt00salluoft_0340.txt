see Florus, iii. 3, and particularly Plutarch, in his lise of Ma-
rius, who defeated and destroyed them in the two great battles
of Aquae Sextiae and Vercellae.

2. Quo metu] ‘⁴ In consternation at which defeat.”

3. mique, et inde usque, etc.] “Both the Romans of
that day, and since, down to my own times.'' This harsh and
ungrammatical sentence Kritz would emend conjecturally‚ by
reading ibique (i. q. et tum), for illique; “both then and since.''

4. Sic habuere] “Have been convinced of this.'’ Comp.
Cic. acl Div. xiv. 4, sic habeto, mi Tiro, neminem esse qui me
amet quin, etc.

5. Prona] “Easy to be subdued,’' i. q. fizcilz'a, with
which it is joined, c. 80, id facilius proniusque fuit.

6. Pro salute, etc-J Comp. Cic. de Off. i. 12, cum Cimbris
bellum gerebatur, uter esset, non uter imperaret.

7. Absens] This was contrary to the law, which required
that a candidate for the consulship should appear in the forum
on three successive nundinae, and canvass the voters. A gene-
ral who waited for a triumph might not enter the city, and
accordingly was in strictness preveuted from suing for the con-
sulship. To be released from this law was considered a great
honour and favour. Julius Caesar claimed a triumph for his
victories in Spain as praetor, A.U. 694; but he was eager to
obtain the consulship, and was compelled to forego the coveted
honour in order to acquire the more valuable dignity.

8. Triumphum-it] Marius triumphed over Jugurtha on the
first of January‚ 650, the commencement of his second consul-
ship. J ugurtha, with his two sone, was led before his car, and
carried off to the Mamertine prison, under the Capitoline hills,
where he was thrown into the lowest dungeon and left to
starve. Plut. Mar. 12. Captive generals thus led in triumph
were often put to death immediately afterwards, as Vercinge-
torix by Caesar, generally strangled. But in other cases they
were allowed to live. Marius was considered vainglorious for
entering the senate-house in his triumpha] robe. Liv. Epit.
lxvii.
