CHAPTER XIX.

1. Quaestor pro praetore] “A quaestor with praetor’s rank.'‘
Having served the inferior office of quaestor, commissioner of
the treasury, at Rome, Piso was sent to govern the Hither
Spain, with the superior rank of propraetor, ordinarily given
only to such as had served the praetorship at home. But, as

insolentiam quis existimet memet studium meum laudando

ral;⁷' plures always comparative, with reference to another
smaller number.
