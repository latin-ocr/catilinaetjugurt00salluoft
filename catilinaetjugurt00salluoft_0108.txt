76 SALL USTII CATILINA.

11. Praedae fuerat] “Had been an occasion of booty,

illegitimate gain.'' Comp. c. 48. nam alia belli facinora praedae
magis quam detrimento fore.

12. Petitionem] “ Suit for the consulship.’‘

CHAPTER XXII.

1. Populares] Properly‚ “of his own nation:’' hence,
“ associatesss’ as Catil. 24. quod factum primo populares conju-
rationis concusserat. Terent. Phorm. i. 1. 1. amicus summus

meus et popularis Geta. Donatus on Ter. Adelph. ii. 1. 1.
popularitas in omnis rei consortium sumitur.

2. Adigeret] This reading (for adiceret or addiceret)
,Quessed by Cortius, has been confirmed by MSS. The phrase
is common: adigere without the prep. occurs: as Caes. Bell.
Civ. i. 76. ipse idem jusjurandum adigit Afranium; and 11. 28.

3. Humani corporis sanguinem] The redundant expres-
sion seems intended for emphasis. This ceremony is men-
tioned hythe historiam, Florus, iv. 1; Dion Cass. xxxvii. 20,
who adds that a boy was slain sor the purpose. But the
cnstom of ratifying an oath by drawing blood from the body⁴
and drinking it existed among the Scythians and Dacians, and
was probably in this case a remnant of an old Italian supersti-
tion. The Christian apologists pointed with triumph to this
liorrid rite. Minucius, Octav. 30. et quod Saturni filio dignum
est...ipsum credo docuisse sanguinis foedere conjurare Catili-
nam. Cicero may possibly allude to it -ἰη Catil. 1. sica. quae
quidem quibus abs te initiata sacris et devota sit...; but Sallust
himself insinuatos that it was at least unknown to Cicero.
Perhaps it was a single drop of blood mixed in a bowl of wine
to preserve the shadow of an antique ceremonial.

4. Atque eo dictitare fecisse quo] “And they went on
to say, he did so in order that,’⁷ &c Dictitczoe. The historic
infin. ς the subject being the same as to fuere qui dicerent. So
Dietsch and others, after the common reading, which however
seems hardly admissible. The MSS. vary, e. g. dictante, dictare,
dictitavere, but present nothing satisfactory. Dictitarent, “they
repeated,'’ or “asseverated,'’ would give sense, but has no
authority. Eo...quo, “in order that.’‘

5. Alius 3111...οο110011] The dat.; as in the construction,
conscire sibi. Terent. Heaut. i. 1. (59. qui fuere et consen.
Tac. Αηη. i. 43. flagitiorum exercitui meo conscius.

6. Ciceronis invidiam] Passive, “the odium against
Cicero‚⁷' when he was afterwards accused by the tribune
