CHAPTER XII.

1. Loca propinqua thesauris] i. e. the cities or fortified
places in which the royal treasures were deposited, or which
secured the command of them. No such place as Thirmida is
known. Hippo (the modern Bona) and Cirta (Constantina)
were the principa] cities of Numidia.

2. Proximus lictor] The lictors walked before the magis-
trates at Rome, and the last of these, who immediately pre-
ceded the magistrate, was therefore proximus to him. The,
Roman writers constantly apply their own ternis to foreign
Officers, &ca lictor means here, “an attendant.'’ Pica-imus,
here metaphorically, “most confidential.'’ So the cant phrase,
proximus sum egomet mihi.

3. Onerat] Comp. Liv. xxiv. 13, Hannibal oneratos in-
gentibus promissis domum redire jubet. Tac. Histor. i. 25,

62, homo servus. Cic. acl Div. vii. 22, homo gladiator. We
say, “a maid servant,'' ‘⁴ a waiting woman;'' but in Latin the
sex is indicated by thc form of the qualify‘mg word, ancilla,
servu-³, ἄρ.
