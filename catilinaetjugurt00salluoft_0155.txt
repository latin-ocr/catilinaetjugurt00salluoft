innocentia is opposed to avaritia 111 c.12‚ and J119111246.

6. Esse quam videri bonus] This may be taken from

θέλει. Τ110 111011,11011·ε101, 15 common. Comp. Cic. De Amic.

CHAPTER LV.

1. Noctem...antecapere] “ To anticipate nightfall.”

2. Triumviros] Scil. capitales: magistrates who had the
charge of the prisons and of public executione. Hence triumvi-
rale supplicium. Tac. Αηη. v. 9.

3. Praesidiis] Juvenal, viii. 233. galeatum ponit ubique
Praesidium attonitis

4. Quod. Tullianum appellatur] The Carcer, a public
prison, under the eastern side of the Capitoline hill, was built
by Ancus, and enlarged by Servius Tullius, Varro, de L. L.
iv. 32. carcer a coercendo, quod exire prohibentur: in hoc pars
quae sub terra Tullianum, quod additum a Tullio rege. Comp.
Liv. xxiv. 22. This place now exists, and. is used as a chapel
to a church built over it, in honour of the supposed imprison-
ment there of St Peter. Formerly criminals were let down into
it by a hole in the chamber above. Quod 15 made to agree with
Tullianum, by prolepsis or anticipation, rather than with carcer.
The neuter quilianum may depend on robur, ‘a prison‚’'
understood.

5. Ascenderis] Some editions read escemleris, with the
same sense, but with no authority. Certain MSS. give descen-
deris, which would imply descent within the walls of the carcer
to the chamber called the Tullianum on the left hand, the
entrance to which was reached by twelve steps. But the phrase
ubi ascendam-3, which has most authority, seems to imply some
common passengers' route, and refers, probably, to the ascent
of the street in which the career stood from the forum, and
this agrees with the existing localities.
