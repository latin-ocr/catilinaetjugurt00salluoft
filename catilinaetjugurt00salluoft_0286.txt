126 SALLUSTJI JUGURTHA.

CH'APTER XXXII.

1. captae] “taken illegally.” Tac. Ann. iii. 67, saevitiae
captarumque pecuniarum teneri reum.

2. Arcessebant] “Demanded for trial.” Tae. Αηη. 11. 50,
arcessere majestatis. Suet. Claud. 37, arcessi statim ac mori
jussus est, “to be tried and executed.’'

3. Perfugas] Pevfnya seems strictly to mean “one who
seeks perfugium, refuge, by abandoning his post or party‚''
transfuya, “one who deserts his own party and takes refuge
with another.” But no such distinction is strictly observed.

4. Talis ea tempestate fama de cassio erat] “Such at
that time was the estimation in which Cassius was held.⁷’

CHAPTER XXXIII.

1. contra decus regium] “In a manner the reverse of
royal.” Comp. Tac. Hist. i. 82, eontra decus imperii, “the
honour and glory of legitimate authority.” Luc. vii. 588, of
Brutus, Ο decus imperii, spes O suprema senatus.

2. In vincula] “ To prison.”

3. Numidiae] Gen. for abl. Numidia, “in Numidia.''
The use of the genitive for the name of a country is irregular;
butis here occasioned by the proximity of the genitive of α
city, Romae. In English we should say, at Rome, but in
Numidia.

4. corrupturum] “He would injure.'’

CHAPTER XXXIV.

1. Quae ira fieri amat] “Which anger delights to have
used.” Quintilian, iv. 3. 17, says: Graeca vero translata vel
Sallustii plurima, quale est vulgus amat fieri. This passage,
apparently corrupt, has been supposed to refer to that before
115, and has been variously altered to apply to it. In Thucyd.
viii. 1, we find ὅπερ φιλεῖ δῆμος ποιεῖν; and perhaps we should
read facere 111 Quintilian. The idiom φιλεῖ ’γίγνεσθαι 15 imitated
by late Latin writers, as Auson. ad G'ratian. 1, ut apud Deum
fieri amat. Dictys, 1. 3, 510111 111 re tali fieri amat3 but this
usage is not found in better authors. Still less would the
Greek idiom of the verb sing. with the neuter plural be admis-
sible. In Juqur. 41, we read: scilicet ea quae res secundae
amant.
