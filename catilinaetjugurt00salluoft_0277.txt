NOTES. 117

4. secus cesserat] “Had been less successful than 110
had expected.'' secus has the force of a comparative, Juyur.
92, rem haud secus difficilem, “not less difficult.” In other
places Sallust uses it with negation and atque, in the sense of
“ otherwise than.⁷' Juyur. 100, neque secus atque in mari.

5. Animo...invaserat] comp. Cic. in Verr. i. 51, qui
jam spe et opinione praedam illam devorasset. Ad Att. i. 16,
ille autem regis haereditatem spe devoraverat.

6. Praedas] This word is used in the plur. in Jugyur. 32,
41, 44. Booty may be of various kinds, or carried off by
various persons, or from various places.

CHAPTER XXI.

1. Obvius procedit] For the use of the adjective instead
of the adverb obviam, comp. diversus, Juqur. 12, 46, 50, and
the phrases certantes agere, ἄκρην. 44, frequentes incederent,
Ju‘qufr. 46, festinare pergit, Jufflcr. 52, properantes arma ca-
piunt, vaur. 53, occultus veniat, ἄειραν. 61, quo improvisus
gravior accederet, J nour. 88, citi sese ostendunt, εῙιιςμιν. 101.

2. Cirtam] Cirta, Gr. Κίρτα, apparently i. q. the Phoe-
nician Kartha, “a city;’' called afterwards by the Romans
Sittianorum colonia, from the followers of P. Sittius, a Roman
adventurer who assisted Caesar in his African campaign;
known infmodern times by the name oi Oonstantineh. It lies
about 40 miles inland, on the river AmpsagaS, and was one of
the principal cities of Numidia.

3. Die] An old form of the gen. Virg. Geo. i. Libra die
somnique pares ubi fecerit horas. This form is preserved by
the MSS. in several places in Sallust, eg. ἄκρην. 52, 97,
though here many read diei.

4. Plerumque noctis processit] Comp. Juyur. 51, multum
diei processerat. Lucan, vii. 423, compares the advance of the
Roman empire to the progress of a heavenly body through the
sky: Te geminum Titan procedere vidit in axem.

is properly the body from whence light issues, lux the light
diffused. Doederl. Synon. 11. 66. But Virg. Aen. Vi. 356,
vix lumine quarto Prospexi Italiam, poetically‚ as we should
say, “with the fourth sun‚” i. e. on the fourth day.
