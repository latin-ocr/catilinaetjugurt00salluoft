bably of Suessa Pometia, in Latium, whence the paludes
Pomptinae derived their name. This Pomptinius suceeeded
Murena in Transalpine Gaul, and effected the final paoification

' 3. In ponte Mulvio] The Muhian, or Milvian bridgc
(perhaps, srom M. Aemilius Scaurus, who is said to have built it),
crossed the Tiber on the Flaininian way, two miles north of
Rome. The great battle between Constantine and Maxentius,
ΑΔ). 312, took its name from this bridge. It is now called
Ponte Molle: some part of the structure is supposed to bc
original. A bridge would be a convenient spot for intercepting
travellerS. At such a point it was more difficult to escape.
Being narrow, and generally with a considerable elevation,
carriages would slacken their pace at them. Beggars and
loiterers infested them, and waylaycrs might keep a look out
from them without exciting suspicion.

d 8. cito cognito consilio] “quickly apprehending the
evrce.'’

9. lvrtulta...obtestatus] “Urging Pomptinius with many
argumen S.’⁷

10. Dedit] Probably the pree. from dedo, “gives himself
up: '' dedo iniplies more entire submission than the simple do.

dediderunt.
