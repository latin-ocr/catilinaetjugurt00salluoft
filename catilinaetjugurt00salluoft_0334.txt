174 SALLUSTH JUGUBTHA.

3. Persequi] More properly persequendi ; but the infin.
ἓεέξὲῃῑῖε the idea of non cogeres, implied in demeres necessitu-

4. Inopi] This word may be enclosed in brackets. If it
agree with populo, it must mean that the Romans had conti-
nued feeble from the first: if with principio, it should be writ-
ten inope, and transposed, ab inope principio. But it is sup-
ported by the MSS. generally. Imperi, written perhaps impi,
is a plausible conjecture.

5. Offensae minimum, gratia par] “Very little opportu-
nity for quarrelling, and as much regard and favour as if we
were your near neighbours.'’

6. Parentes] “ Subjects.'’ See note on J ιιῃιιν. 3.

7. cui scilicet placuisse] “Whom it has pleased.⁷' The
infin. governed by scilicet, i.e. seire licet .· as Juyur. 113, quae
scilicet...occulta pectoris patefecisse. Fr. H ist. i. 19, at seilicet
eos...gratiam ab co peperisse.

8. Pro delicto suo] ‘⁶ In excuse for his fault.'’

9. Unde vi Jugurtham expulerit] Many MSS. and Edd·
read expulerat. Bocchus had not expelled Jugurtha from any
part of his doniinions3 but this latter reading would make the
author assert t'he fact. Expulerit may imply that Bocchus
made the assertion, which was a false one. Translate: “A
part of Numidia, says he, from which he pretends to have ex-
pelled J ugurtha, had become his own by the right of conquest.”
Ciacconius conjectured, si inde Romanos apuleo-it: and other
corrections have been proposed: but there seems to be no satis-
factory way of explaining the passage.

CHAPTER (3111.

1. Turrim...qu0] See note 3 on c. 66, Vagenses quo Me-
tellus praesidium imposuerat.

2. Praesidium] According to the construction, merely in
apposition to perfugas ‚· but with a pregnant sense, i. e. ‘⁴ so as
to be a garrison.⁷' Comp. Tac. Arm. i. 3, Augustus subsidia
dominationi Claudium Marcellum...et M. Agrippam extulit.
Liv. i. 8, Romulus locum...asylum aperuit.

3. venerant] i. q. evenerant. Comp. Liv. i. 7, priori
Remo augurium venisse fertur.

4. Sine decore] “Without the ensigns of their office as
ambassadors ”
