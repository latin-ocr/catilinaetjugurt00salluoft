NOTES. 77.

Clodius of getting Roman citizens punished with death without
an appeal to the people. For this sense of the word comp. c.
6. invidia ex opulentia orta est; and c. 23. nobilitas invidia
(Ciceronis) aestuabat. Cicero himself thus defines it (Tusc.
Disp. iv. 7. 16) invidia non in eo qui invidet solum dicitur, sed
etiam in eo cui invidetur.

' 7. Pro magnitudine] “Considering its importance.’'

CHAPTER XXIII.

1. coopertus] “Ove1·whelmed.⁷’ We say, “covered with
infainy,'' or “with ridicule ;‘' the Romans applied the meta-
phor to the deeds themselves, as Cic. in Ver. i. 4. sceleribus
coopertum. Liv. xxxix. 15. cooperti stupris. Horace’s use of
the phrase approaches nearer to ours: Sat. ii. 1. 68. Famosis-
que Lupus coopertus versibus.

2. Senatu...moverant] This is the phrase for “expel-
ling from the senate,'’ which was done by the censor omitting
the name on reading the list of the order at the lustrum.
Comp. Liv. xxvii. 11. xxxiv. 44. xxxviii. 28. The same phrase
is applied more generally, statu, possessione movere. Amoverant,
the reading of one MS. and several editions, is incorrect.

3. suamet] The termination met, is generally confined to
esm, τιι, and sui ; occasionally however we find meummet, meamet.
meimet.

4. Prorsus] “In short.⁷’ See note on c. 15.

5. Neque dicere neque facere, etc.] “Reckless in every
thing he said or did :³³ not merely careless, but wanton and
desperate: as Vell. ii. 95. Clodius qui neque dicendi neque
faciendi ullum nisi quem vellet nosset modum. Compare the
same phrase in Liv. xxvi. 15.

6. Consuetudo] “Intimacy‚'’ more particularly “sexual;”
Lucr. v. 1279 consuetudo concinnat amorem: then “criminal‚”
as in this⁴ pliace: stupri, though supplied in some editions,
is not require .

7. Maria montesque] The commentators have collected
passages where “scas and mountains of gold'' are spoken of
hyperbolically: as e.g. montes auri polliceri, χρυσίου πόντος, διο.
Persius, ii. 65. uses montes, absolute, for “heaps of gold;''
Cratero magnos promittere montes.

8. Obnoxia] scil. amori, affectui: as Tac. Amr. xvi. 6:
i. q. moriqera, ‘⁶ obedient.'’ So in Seneca, obnoxius ιίοηιὶηο.
