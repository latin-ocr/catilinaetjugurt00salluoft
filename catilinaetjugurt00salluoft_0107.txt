NOTES. 75

3. condicio belli] “Condition, or ternis on which they
were to engage.” Conclltio and condicio may be regarded as
originally different words, the first from condere, ‘⁶ making ” or
“construction‚’' the second from dicio (connected with dice),
“terms,’' “circumstances” “state of life‚'’ dcc„ but these
merged eventually into one, which was spelt according to
the more obvious derivation, conditio.

id haberet. Comp. 47. quid aut qua de causa consilii habuisset.

5. 'rabulas novas] “Fresh tablets,'' i. e. an abolition of

tabernam scilicet, vel ante eum locum, in quo negotiatio exer-
cetur, nec in loco remoto, sed in evidenti. Hence the pro-
clamation by which the lives or properties of citizens were
declared forfeited were called proscriptione. Sulla was the
