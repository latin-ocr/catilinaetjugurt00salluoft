98 SALLUSTII CATILJNA.
CHAPTER XXXVHI.

1. Gn. Pompeio et Μ. crasso coss] Am. 684.

2. :tribunicia potestas restituta est] Among the principa]
measures of Sulla for curbing the pretensions of the Marian or
popular party at Rome, and securing to the senate the adminis-
tration of affairs, was the restrictiori he placed upon the
prerogative of the tribunes of the plebs. Comp. Appian, Bell.
Giv. i. 100. τὴν δὲ τῶν δημάρχων ἀρχὴν ἴσα καὶ ἀνεῖλεν, αἶσθενε-
στάτην ἀποφήνας, καὶ νόμῳ κωλύσας μηδεμίαν ἄλλην τὸν δήμαρχον
ἀρχὴν ἔτι ἄρχειν. Liv. Epit. lxxxix. tribunorum plebis potes-
tatem minuit et omne jus ferendarum legum ademit. The
ancient right of intercessio, or a veto ou motions in the senate,
still remained to them. At the same time Sulla confined the
comitia of the tribes to the election of the inferior magistrates
forbidding it to enact laws οι· receive criminal appeals. All
these prerogatives were restored by a Lex Pompeia, in the year
above mentioned. Vell. ii. 30. Pompeius tribuniciam potesta-
tem restituit, cujus Sulla imaginem sinc re reliquerat.

3. Adolescentes] Properly adolescentia extended from 15
to 30 years of age. But the term was frequently applied to
persons of more advanced age. Thus Cicero, Philipp. ii. 46,
calls himself an adolescens in the time of his consulship, when
he was 44 years of age. Sallust, speaking of Caesar in his
thirty—seventh year, calls him adolescentulus, Catil. 49. In
this place homines adolescentes may be rendered “rising men;⁷'
that is, men who were beginning to become important politica]
characters.

4. Summam potestatem] Meaning the tribunate, which
ῗὶῐέοὲῄὲξέ lex Pompeia had become the most influential office in

5. senati specie] “Under pretence of supporting the
authority of the senate‚⁷’ but really to maintain their own
ascendancy. Comp. Lucan, ix. 206. non jam regnare pudebit,
Nec color imperii, nec frons erit ulla senatus: “henceforth
men will act the king without scruple, there will be no colour
of legitimate command, nor pretence of senatorial authority.’'

6. Sicuti] “As though.'' Comp. Catil. 31. sicuti jurgio
lacessitus foret.

7. Potentia] Power‚ without respect to its legality, and
generally in opposition to legitimate authority, potestas. Comp.
Catil. 39. paucorum potentia crevit. Lucan, iv. infin. z

Jus licet in jumilos nostros sibi-fecerat ense
sylla potens. Mariusque ferox. et Cinna cruentus,

Caesareaeque domus series, cui tanta potestas
Concessa est: emere omnes, hic vendidit urbem.
