118 SALL USTII CATILINA.

the sui-name of Uticensis, from the place of his death. He
was born, AJJ. 659, B.0. 95. Accordingly, he was at this time
32 years of age. He had not yet served any high office, and
was only beginning to become known in the political world.
The uncompromising opinions he expressed on this occasion
marked him out as a leader for the nobles, who were dissatisfied
with Pompeius and Crassus, and disdained Cicero for his
obscure origin.

3. Orationem habuit] Cicero characterizes Cato’s speech
on this occasion in his pleading for Sestius, c. 28. consule me,
quum esset designatus tribunus plebis, obtulit in discrimen
vitam suam3 dixit eam sententiam, cujus invidiam capitis
periculo sibi praestandam videbat3 dixit vehementer, egit
acriter, ea quae sensit prae se tulit3 dux, auctor, actor illarum
rerum fuit. Comp. Vell. ii. 35. The beginning of this speech
may be compared with that of the third Olynthiac of Demos-
thenes.

The conciseness of Sallust’s style is observable in his use of
the neut. adject. for substantives; e. g. alieni appetenS‚ sui
profusus for alienarum, suarum rerum. This is particularly
noticeable in the use of the words bonum, mulum, commodum,
certum, aequum, honestum, and others. Dietsch.

4. Aris atque focis] The best opinion seems to be that
both these words refer to the citizens⁷ private (lwellings; the
ara being the altar of the Penates, in the central court of the
house (impluvium), the focus the hearth in the hall (atrium)
around which the little images of the Lares were ranged. See
Ernesti ‘ln Clav. Cicer. v. Ara.

5. cavere ab mis, quam] Manis is omitted by the best
critics 0¹3 the authority of many MSS. So in cc. 8, 9, 48.

6. cujuscumque modi sunt] The indic. mood implying
the certainty in the mind of the speaker of there being such
things. Comp. below, cujus haec cumque modi videntur. Cic.
de Off. i. 25. utilitatem civium tueantur, ut quaecunque agunt,
ad rem publicam referant. Tac. Ann. i. 42. quicquid istuc
sceleris imminet.

l ‘si capessite rem publicam] “Take public affairs in
ian .’'

8. 111 dubio] i.e. in periculo. Comp. Ovid, Amor. ii. 13.
2. In dubio vitae nostra Corinna jacet.

9. In hoc ordine] “Iu this assembly‚'' i. e. before the
senatorial order.

10. Haud saeue, etc.] “I am not wont easily to forgive
