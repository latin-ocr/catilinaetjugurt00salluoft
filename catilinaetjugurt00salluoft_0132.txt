offices at any time; ceteri, the rest of them, who were at the
same time not in office, such as the defeated candidates; but
more especially the tribunes of the peopbe, who are said to be in
mayistratu, incorrectly, because the tribunate was not strictly
a magistracy‚ but who frequently used their power, as such, to
harass the real magistrates the consuls and praetors. Dis-
appoiuted candidates, especially if they were tribunes, excited
the people against their miei-53 but by an unscrupulous use of
the judicia the magistrates, secure themselves, terrified them
into moderation. Placidius tractarent, “keep them quiet,’' as
opposed to accenderent or exaqitarent. But this sense is ques-
tionable. Placiczms tractarent should rather mean, ‘⁸ treat
with kindness;” and Kritz's emendation, qui for quo, seems
preferable.

9. A. Fulvius] comp. Val. Max. V. 8. 5, who makes this
the name of the father. The father, by the old Roman law,
had power oi life and death over his child up to any age. In-
stances are given of parents calling their relations together
and sitting in judgment on their sons for public crimes. But
this right had become obsolete, and its exercise would not have
been endured in this ease, but for the prejudice os the govern-
ment against Catiline and his abettors.

10. Quod modo bello usui foret] “As long as they could
be of any service, at least for fighting, if sor nothing else.’¹

CHAPTER XL.

1. Legatos Allobrogum] The Allobroges, a tribe between
the Rhone and Isere, had sent envoys to Rome to complain of
the exactione of the provincial government, and to sue for a
remissiori of their public debts. They had been with difficulty
conquered, aud had more than once revolted. Cicero says of
them, in Catil. iii. 6. quam gentem unam restare (of all the
southern Gauls) quae populo Romano bellum facere et posse,
et non nolle videretur. Comp. Caes. B. G. i. 6. Q. Fabius
