Ant. ct L. Catil. Piso perierat in Hispania, ibique dum in-
jurias provincialibus facit, occisus est. SaHust's insinuation
against Pompeius is not credible; he had not sufficient motive,

there was any domestic treachery, it lies with the Senatorial
party itself.

ἓὲιὲηὲἔέοὲὲῖξω he had already arrived, as appears from Dion

tinction, if correctly observed, comes to this, sunt qui dicunt,
“there are some, I know, who say;’' sunt qai dicant, “some,

Facturusne operae pretium sim. Drakenborch, on this passage.
collects similar instances. See Liv. vii. 11, 13, 143 xxi. 93 xxii. ’

navis? eripietne suum?

10. clientes] Persons whom Pompeius had attached to
himself in the province when he commanded there against
Sertorius: such as Caesar (Bell. Civ. i. 75) calls beneficiarii.
