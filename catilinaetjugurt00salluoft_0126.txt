94 SALL USPII CATILINA.

6. Licet cognoscas] “ You may ascertain if you please.’'

7. Statum dignitatis] Cortiiis observes that status is
the position a man holds, yradas that which he sech, there-
fore proposes to substitute the latter for the former here3 on
the supposition that status dignitatis means the consulship
which Uatiline failed to obtain. It refers, however, to the
position which Catiline already occupied. Translate : “I could
not maimain the privilege of my high position, Which author-
ized me to expect success in suing for the consulship.’' Comp..
c. 18. Catilina, pecuniarum repetundarum reUS, prohibitus erat
consulatum petere. Obtinere; most properly to hold, keep,
preserve: only in a secondary sense, to acquir-Q obtain.

8. Meis nominibus] Summum, which occurs here in some
MSS., is a gloss, to explain the construction: “debts eon-
tracted on my own account,” “inscribed in the ledger with
my name:’' (nomen or uomina may be used indifferently),
alienis nom. sub. aes alienum sumptum, “debts incurred as
surety for others‚'’ “inscribed with others’ names’'

1. In agro Arretino] Arretium, mod. Arezzo‚ lay al·
most on the direct road from Rome to Faesulae. This reading
is therefore preferred to Reatino4 which most editions follow.
Reate, in the country of the Saffines, was far to the right.

2. Exornat] “Furhishes:” s0, classem exornare, “to
equip a fleet.'‘

3. cum fascibus] The fasces, i.e. an axe in a bundle of
rods, was the ensign of the higher magistr-acies of the city.
This was accordingly an usurpation of official rank: as
Plutarch says in his life of Cicero, c. 16. Cicero in Catil. ii. 6.
quum arma. quum secures, quum fasces, quum tubas, quum
signa militaria, quum aquilam illam argenteam scirem esse
praemissam.
