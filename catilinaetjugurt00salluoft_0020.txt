distinguished statesmen mentioned above. Sallust
therefore is the first Roman historian whose account
of these times became generally accepted by his own
countrymen as authoritative. He owes this distinction
probably quite as much to the charm of his style, as to

he seems to have been the first of the Roman writers
who made style a matter of primary importance. The
idea however that he took Thucydides for his model,
rests upon the occurrence of a few philosophical re-
flexions, which seem to be (lirectly imitated from the
Greek writer. In the mere form of Sallust's expres-
sions it would be difficult to point out any such
resemblances to his supposed master. Segrega speaks
correctly of his amputatae sententis& et verba ante ex· ”
pectatzcm cadentem. The charge against him of affect-
ing archaic words was made by his own contemporaries.
Lenaeus, above spoken of, calls him priscorum Catonis-
que verborum inermlitissimum furem. Another writer,
Ateius the grammarian, was supposed to have assisted
the historiam by collecting antique words for him to
interweave with his own language.

I cannot however distinguish any such character
in Sallust’s extant writingS. In the Catilina and
J ugurtha there 15 not, I believe, a single word used
which is not also of frequent occurrence in contem-
porary and later writers. It 15 probable indeed that
he clung to the old orthography of many words at a

time when great innovations in that respect were
