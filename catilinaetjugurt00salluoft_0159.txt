NOTES. 127

16. Tribunus] Seil. militum. There were six of these to
each legion. In early times they commanded the legion
successively day by day, and even at this period a tribune
might still be called by courtesy‚ the commander of a legion.
Horace, at the age of 22, joined the army of M. Brutus in
Greece, and was appointed a tribunus. He says of himself x
Quod mihi pareret legio Romana tribuno. It is impossible
th'at so young and obscure a man could have been actual
commander of a legion.

17. Praefectus] The eommander of the auxiliary horse,
appointed by the imperator from among his Roman officere.

18. regatus] The consul's or imperator’s lieutenant,
generally in command of a detaehment.
