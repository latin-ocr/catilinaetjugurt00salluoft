NOTES. 113

3. Valet] Scil. animus.

4. Recte atque ordine] A familiar idiom. Comp. Liv.
xxiv. 31; xxviii. 39; xxx. 17.

5. Bello Macedonico] Perses, or Persem, the last of the
kings of Macedonia, was subdued by L. Aemilius Paullus at the
battle of Pydna, A.u. 586, Re. 168. Perses is the form of the
name adopted by Cicero and Sallust, Perseus by Livy, Pliny,
Justin, and Eutropius.

6. Rhodiorum civitas] The state of Rhodes became famous
as the greatest maritime power of the eastern Mediterranean‚
after the fall of Athens in the fourth century 13.c. It had
proved itself a faithful ally of the Romans in the war with
Antiochus, king of Syria (Β. ο. 100), and had received from
them the countries of Lycia and Caria. In the Macedonian
war it inclined to the other side, or, at least, trimmed between
the two. Comp. Vell. i. 9. dubia fide speculati fortunam pro-
niores regis partibus fuisse visi sunt.

7. Impunitos] The Romans did not turn their arms upon
them, and overthrow their commonwealth: they contented
themselves with taking from them their possessions in Lycia
and Caria. See Liv. xlv. 25. Comp. also A. Gellius, vii. 3.

8. Per inducias] ‘⁶ In time of truce.”
9. Per occasionem] ⁴ ‘ When opportunity offered.’'
10. Talia fecere] “Did the like,'⁷ “ retaliated.”

11. In illis] “In their case.” Comp. Catil. 9. in amicis
fideles3 and examples there given.

-1²·„ Hoc idem] ‘⁶ This, which is a similar case to the fore-
gomg.

13. Novum consilium] “A new course of proceeding,”
unusual, novel3 i.e. the proposition of Silanus for infiicting
death on the conspirators, which the senate had no right to do.
No Roman citizen could, in strict law, be condemned to death,
except by a vote of the people. On the other hand, the senate
by the appointment of a dictator, or by investing the consuls
with summary powers, by a senatus-consultum ultimum, i.e.
caveant consules ne respublica aliquid detrimenti capiat, claimed
the right of suspending the ordinary operation of the laws. The
'people always regarded these stretches of prerogative as illegal
encroachments, and in the sequel declared‚ at the instigation
of the tribune Clodius, that Cicero had committed a judicial
rnlurder in executing the conspirators by virtue of a decree of
t e senate.
