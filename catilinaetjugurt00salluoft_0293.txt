NOTES. 133

12. Quasi permixtio terrae] “Like an earthqua1‹e‚'’ in
which the strata of the soil are thrown into confusion and
change places. The boldness of the illustration is acknow-

ledged by the word quasi, ‘⁶ as it were.”

CHAPTER XLII.

1. majores] Tib. and C. Gracchus were grandsous on the
mother’s side of P. Scipio Africanus major, the conqueror of
Hannibal. See Plutarch, Tib. Gracch. 1.

2. vindicare...in libertatem] “To claim freedom for the
people :'’ the legal phrase for the declaration before the praetor
of a slave's manumission. Vindicare may stand by itselt’. Liv.
iii. 46, ita vindicatur Virginia spondentibus propinquis.

3. Spes* societatis] Scil. the hope of being oonjoined with
the nobility in the enjoyment of magistraeies, provincial govern-
ments, and other advantages.

4. Eadem] Neut. plur. “undertaking the same enterprise.⁷’
Liv. xlv. 23, vix ea quibus fidit ingredientem.

5. 'triumvirum col. deduc] One of three commissioners
forestablishing colonies of Roman citizens on the public do-
mains,

6. Sane] “It must be allowed.'' The partiality of the
writer for the Gracchi has already been shewn in the use of the
word necaverat, ‘⁴ mm·dered.‘'

7. Bono] “To a good man.‘’

8. Malo more] “After a bad fashion,” so as to become
mali exempli, a bad precedent. Comp. Tac. Amz. i. 35, saevum
id malique moris etiam saevientibus visum est.

9. Ferro aut fuga exstinxit] The figure zeugma, where
one verb is coupled with two substantives though its sense
applies properly only to one. Thus extingui ferm, “to be
destroyed by the sword‚'’ is a legitimate expression, but not
extingui fuya. Exscinquere (Gr. στίζω) “to prick or scratch
out.”

10. Ulcisci] “To punish‚‘’ “to wreak vengeance upon.”
This is the primary meaning of the word, to avenae (an injury,
a friend‚) is secondary, and much less frequent. For the sense
of the passage compare Thucyd. iii. etz, πάντι δὲ τρόπῳ, κ.τ.λ.

11. Si...parem] ‘⁶ If I should undertake.’'
