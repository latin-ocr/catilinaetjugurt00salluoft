crisis of the civil wars which was soon about to be
developed. The early career· of Marius and Sulla,
their selfish ambition and personal antagonisni, serve
as a pref-ace to the records of slaughter and proscrip-
tion with which their names were to become con-
spicuously blended. Jugurtha himself, the crafty
Numidian, bold and active, with inexhaustible re-
sources and devoid of seruples, combining the subtilty
of the Carthaginian with the ferocity of the Moor‚ is
interesting not only on his own account, but as a type
of the African character, such as it was afterwards
exemplified in Tacfarinas, and recently in Abd-el-
kader. The struggle of the serpent and the eagle, so
favourite a subject with poet-s and painters, has been

dclineated by no historiali more vividly than by Sallust. ·

In the present revised edition the readings of
Kritz's text (Lips. 1828) have been generally adopted,
and his system of punctuation followed. The notes
have been carefully corrected, and some addition
made to them. It will be observed that many idio-
matio passages from the poets have been introduced,
to assist the understanding of the text, but- partly
also to show how much the style of Sallust approaches
to that of poetry, and still more from the idea that
youthful readers will take more interest in verse than
in prose illustrations, and better retain what they

learn from them.
