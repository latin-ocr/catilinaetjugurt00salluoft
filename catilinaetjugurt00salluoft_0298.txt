138 SALL USTJJ JUGURTHA.

4. Pertingens] “ Stretching on.” There is said to be
no instance of the word being thus used, and some critice would
read pertinens, but unnecessarily.

5. Humi] Gen. cas, ae, Tac. Arm. i. 61, humido paludum ;
iv. 41, secreto loci.

6. consita] “mantem’‘ but as a stronger word than the
simple satus, it here means “overgrown.⁷’ Virg. Aen. iii. 1⁴27,
crebris legimus freta consita terris: “thick sets

CHAPTER XLIX.

1. Transverso itinere] “In a direction at right angles‚’'
i.e. to the mountain.

2. Extenuata acie] “Drawn out in a thiu line.’' Comp.
Suet. cle Bell. Afric. 14, adversariorum equitatus sese exten-
dens, et...Caesaris equitatum extenuare. So applied to the

soar-of a wound; Catull. lxiv. 296, Extenuata gerens veteris
vestlgla poenae.

3. Suos] “His own division.''

4. manipulos] “ Bands of infantry:'' the Roman term
applied loosely to the array of a foreign people.

5. Decuerint] Seii. provideri ; to be supplied from pro-
visa, which follows. Decuerz‘t would be the proper construc-
tlon.

6. Locum superiorem, etc.] Observe the four particulars
in which Jugurtha had provided, like a good general, for vic-
tory3 1. higher ground3 2. knowledge of the country, and of
the kind of warfare required in it; 3. no inferiority in numbers3
4. nor in skill and discipline.

7. prudentes] Scil. belli ,· in everything relating to the
conduct of the war. Fraqm. Hist. iv. 12, belli prudentibus.

8. Pecunia aut honore extulerat] “Had advanced in
wealth or dignity :'’ the proper meaning of extollere, to raise,
promote, is extended by a zeugma to pecunia, which should
properly be connected with such a word as ornare, or locuple-
tare.

9. conspicatur] Scil. hostes: MSS. conspicitur. But
Donatus quotes Sallust’s use of conspicor for conspicio; and the
passage evidently requires the active sense here.
