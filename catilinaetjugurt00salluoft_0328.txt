168 SALLUSTJI JUGURTJJA.

3. Non eadem asperitate...haud secus difficilem] “Not so
perilous, but equally (not less, see on c. 20) difficult.'’ Asper,
fig. fierce, violent, destructive; in which sense it is often joined
with bellum, fata, ἄο.

4. Inter ceteram planitiem] i. q. in cetera planitie. Comp.
c. 88, inter ingentes solitudines oppidum magnum.

5. Administrare] Subaud. operi.

CHAPTER XCIII.

1. Aversum proeliantibus] “On the opposite side to
where they were fighting.'’

2. Animum vertit] “ Seized his mind,” or ‘⁴ struck him.” ⁸

3. coaluerat] The prep. is merely intensive, as in Suet.
Any. 92, palmam in compluvium...transtulit‚ utque coalesceret
magno opere curavit. Ovid, Art. Am. ii. 649, Dum novus in
viridi coalescit cortice ramus, And fig. Tac. Hist. i. 21, dum
Galbae auctoritas fluxa, Pisonis nondum coaluisset: “had not
yet grown to maturity.”

4. castelli planitiem perscribit] Draws a plan of the
fortification as it lay flat beneath him. By perscribit is gene-
rally understood, “reconnoit1·es,'' ‘⁴ examines‚” i. q. perlustrat.
But authority for such a sense is wanting, and there seems to
be no difficulty in supposing that the man drew some rude
plan. But the passage is probably corrupt: in castelli plani—

tiem pervenit, is the reading adopted by Kritz, with the author-
ity of a few MSS.

CHAPTER XCIV.

1. Qui ascensui-1 erant] The reading of many MSS.
seems preferable to the common reading qui centuriis prae-
erant: it is not the four centurione only, but the whole body,
nine in number, who are spoken of.

2. Offensa] Comp. Liv. vii. 36, miles offenso scuto prae-
buit sonitum.

-3. Dubia nisu] i.e. uisui. Comp. Propertius, iv. 4. 81,
Mons erat adscensu dubius

4. Potissimus tentare] “He tried first of all.''

5. Digrediens] “ Stepping aside,” i.e. to leave room for
the others to ascend.
