86 SALL USTII CATILINA.

3. Q. Marcius Rex] Consul with L. Caecilius Metellus,
A.U. 686, and afterwards proconsul in Cilicia. Cicero praises
his courage and military skill, in Pison. 23. Ab Anco Marcio
sunt Marcii Reges. Suet. Cal. 6. Marcius and Martius are
probably the same word.

4. Q. Metellus creticus] Consul with L. Hortensius
A. u. 685: he subdued Crete as proconsul.

5. eircumque loca] “The neighbouring regions:'' circum
and circa are thus used absolutely for quae circ. sunt, very
commonly in Livy. See ix. 11; xxiv. 3. The MSS. read cir-
cumque ea loca, and the emendation is due to Cortius, who saw
that the reading must have arisen from the transcribers’ igno-
rance of the idiom. Ea, meaning Apulia, would make the
passage absurd. Loca is governed by in.

6. Hi utrique] For the more correct form, horum uterque.
So Catil. 5. quae utraque. Tac. Ami. xvi. 11. pater filiam, avia
neptem, illa utrosque intuens, sor utrumque.

7. Ad urbem imperatores] These words are to be con-
nected together: generals returned from their provinces, and
waiting outside the walls for the day of their triumph, before
which they were not allowed to enter the city3 or who, having*
received the imperium, had not yet completed their levies. As-
conius explains the phrase, Act. in Verr. i. 15. sic dici solet de
iis qui cum potestate provinciali aut nuper a provincia revertis-
sent, aut nondum in provinciam profecti essent.

8. calumnia] “Machination‚ cabal‚'' from an old word
caluo, decipio, P1·iscian; who cites a passage from the Historiae
of Sallust: contra ille calui ratus.

9. Q. Pompeius Rufus] This man, who was praetor
A.1]. 691, is to be distinguished from another bearing the same
names, tribune of the people A.U. 702, who made himself con-
spicuous as a turbulent partizan of Cn. Pompeius in that year
sole consul. Rufus, the praetor, is praised by Cicero for his
moderatiori and integrity. After serving the state in the affair
of Catiline, he obtained the proconsular government of Africa.
There were two families belonging to the „qens Pompeia, distin-
guished by the surnames Rufus and Strabo. Cn. Pompeius
Magnus was son of Cn. Pompeius Strabo. The praenomens of
the Rufi, so far as they are known to υς, were Aulus and
Quintus; those of the Strabones, Cnaeus and Sextus.

10. Q. Metellus celer] of the gens Caecilia, one of the
most numerous and widely ramified of the great Roman houses.
One great branch of it bore the surname Metellus3 but this
family again was subdivided‚ and its various offsets were dis-¹
