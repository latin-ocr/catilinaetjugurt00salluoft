the only speaker on that side, but because his speech was the
most effective, and had evidently carried the point. See Cicero
to Atticus, xii. 21. cur ego in sententiam Catonis? quia verbis
luculentioribus et pluribus eandem rem comprehenderat. He
insiste that Cato's merit lay in recommending his own (i.e.
Cieero‘s) policy, whereas M. Brutus, in writing a panegyric on
his uncle Cato, had made it appear as if the capital punishment
had been Cato's original suggestion. Much weight cannot be
given to Brutus's authority on this point, but it is in some
degree corroborated by the silence of Sallust regarding the part
which Cicero claimed in the business.
