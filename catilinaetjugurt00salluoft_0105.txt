would not concede the kingly title. lt has been remarked that
the word tetrarchae is generally found in combination with
reyes, Comp. Sall. Fr. Hist. iv. ⁴26. tetrarchas regesque territos

tiones, regem, tetrarchas. Ιη Vatia. 12. foedere cum civitatibus,
cum regibus, cum tetrarchia Vel. 11. 51. regum, tetrarcharum,

Parthi veluti vulgus sine nomine praeda victorum fuere. (Ob-
