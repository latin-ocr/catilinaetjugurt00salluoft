112 SALL USTII CATILINA.

10. Referendum censuerat] He had proposed that the
question of punishment should stand over for the present, pro·
bably till the issue of the contest with Catilina; the culpi-its
being kept in custody during the interval: praesidiis additis,
⁸⁶ guards placed over thems'

11. Ubi ad eum ventum] There was much irregularity in
the order in which opinions were demanded in the senate. The
consul (or praetor in his absence) who summoned the meeting,
called upon all the rnembers separately to declare their senti-
ments, which they did either in a speech, or by merely assenting
tc the opinion of some preceding speaker; in which case they
rose from their place, and went over to him. At the conclusion
of the debate, the groups thus assembled were counted. Comp.
Plin. Ep. viii. 14. 19. lex aperte jubet dirimi debere sententias
occidentis et relegantis, curn ita discessionem fieri jubet; qui
haec sentitis in hanc partem, qui alia omnia in illam partem
ite, qua sentitis...i. e. in eam in qua sedet qui censuit relegandos
The consul usually called first upon one of the consuls desig-
nate, next upon the consulars, the praetors, and other high
magistrates. But he was not bound to any particular order;
and in the present case we find Catulus, a consular, speaking
aster Caesar, who was praetor-designate. But whatever order
the consul assigned at the commencemont of his term of office,
he was expected to maintain throughout. Caesar’s violating'
this usage, in his own consulship, was remarked upon. See
Suet. Jal. 21. post novam affinitatem, Pompeium primum
rogare sententiam coepit, cum Crassum soleret, essetque con-
suetudo, ut quem ordinem interrogandi sententias consul
kalendis Januan'is instituisset, eum toto anno conservaret.
On this occasion it seems that Crassus was not present,
otherwise Sallust, or Cicero himself, would undoubtedly have
recorded his opinion. He was indignant, perhaps, at the
suspicion of complicity cast upon him. Many of the senators
abstained from attending, from various motives. Comp. Cio.

CHAPTER LI.

1. omnes homines] The beginning of the speech is
supposed to be imitated from Demosthenes, (περὶ τῶν ἐν Χερσο-
νησῳ πραγμάτων) ἔδει μὲν, ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι, τοὺς λέγοντας
ἅπαντας ἐν ὑμῖν μήτε πρὸς ἔχθραν ποιεῖσθαι λόγον μηδένα, μήτε
πρὸς χάριν.

2. Usui] i. e. utilitati. Comp. Cic. pro Ley. Manil. 20.
majores nostros semper in pace consuetudini, in bello utilitati
paruisse. Comp. Nepos, Alcib. 4. plus irae suae quam utilitati
communi paruisse.
