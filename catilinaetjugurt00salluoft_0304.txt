limits of the Roman province at this time. It was afterwards
included in Zeugitana, the district of which Utica was the
capital.

Zama, the second or eastern capital of the kings of Nu-
midia, was styled by the Romans Regia, and is not to be
confounded with the Zama where the great battle between
Scipio and Hannibal was fought, which lay forty or fifty
miles to the west. Mannert, Geoyraplay os the Greeks and
Romans, x. 2, 356.
