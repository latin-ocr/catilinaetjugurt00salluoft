0. 26, Italici, and afterwards neyotiatores, 1. e. Roman settlers
who carried on eommerce in the country.

8. Patratum] “Accomplishedz” a more formal and em-
phatic word than perfectum. See above on c.13.

9. Feret] “Were already: ” the imperf. for the plusq.

perf. implying the immediateness of the act. Comp. nearly the
same words m Tacitus, Ann- xii. 16.

10. Vincis] These were wooden frames, covered with
hides, watties, dvo„ to protect the besiegers, while they worked
their battering ramS‚ or constructed their towers. Vinea is
properly an 11ᾶῇ0015110, agreeing with porticu-‚s (as appears from

So Tac. Arm? xiii. 38, colles clementer assurgentes. Germ. 1,
clementor edito montis jugo.

3. Malitia]‘ ‘vice ” The same opposition 15 found in
Seneca, Epist. 106, quicquid agimus aut mali tiae aut virtutis
gerimus imperio. Cicero indeed, Tusc. disp. iv. 15, opposes
titiositas to vinus, and would confine malitia to a particular
quality, as we say, “malicest ” But in another place, de Nat.
Deor. 111, 30, 110 says that malitza is any versuta et fallax
nocendi ratio.
