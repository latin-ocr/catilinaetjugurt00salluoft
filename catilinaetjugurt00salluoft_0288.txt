128 SALLUSTH JUGURTHA.

13. Urbem venalem] These words should be construed
as the exclamation of J ugurtha They are reported as such by

Livy, Epit. lxiv. and FloruS, 111.1.18. The account in Livy

differed from that of Sallust. The former stated that J uourtha
was himself put to trial for the murder of Massiva, and escaped
secretly. Jugurtha ...... propter caedem admissani in regulum
quendam nomine Massivam, qui regnum ejus populo Rom.
invisi affectabat, Romae interfectum, quum periclitaretur, cau-
sam capitis dicere jussus, clam profugit, et cedens urbe fertur
dixisse, O urbem, etc. Comp. Lucan, iv. ult.:

Emere omnes, hic vendidit Urbem.

CHAPTER XXXVI.

1. Ludificari] The reading of Kritz, for ludificare, in all
the MSS.; the passage being thus quoted by Arusianus in v.
ludificor; and the same form being found in Tacitus, Ama-iii,

ubi instaretur cedens ac rursum in terga remeans3 et dum ea
ratio barbaro fuit, irritum fessumque Romanum impune ludifi-
cabatur.

2. Ex tanta properantia] i.e. ex praegressa tanta prope-
mutia, “After so much haste;” esc implying change out of
one state into another. Hand, Tursell. ii. 646. Eat, ut Grae-
cum ἐκ, (10 proxima consecutione rerum ita usurpatur ut con-
dicio dicatur ex qua alia condicio prodierit. Tac. Germ. 22,
statim e somno lavantur. Liv. xxi. 39, otium ex labore, copia
ex inopia, etc.

3. Aulo fratre...pro praetore relicto] As one to whom
the commander or praetor delegated his authority in his ab·
sence. So Juyur. 104.

CHAPTER XXXVII.

magistracy;” “to keep themselves in office for a further term;’'
i.e. by intercedz'ny, i.e. interrupting by their veto the meetings

longation of Caesar's proconsulate in Gaul, Lucan i. 275:

Quamvis nolente senatu
Traximus imperium.

2. Suthul] This place is unknown. Priscian mentions it
as an instance of barb aious names ending 111 ul. In ul quoque'
unum repeiitur masculinum Latinum, consul; duo communia,
prat-sul, απὸ-αἰ,- et barbara Suthul, Muthul.

3. In praerupti montis extremo] “At the foot of a pre-
cipitous hill, surrounded by a morass.⁷’ So we have summum
