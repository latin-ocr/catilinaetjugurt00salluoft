NOTES. 97

4. Incorruptus] i. e. qni corrumpi nequit. Tac. H ist.
i. 35, Galba minantibus intrepidus, adversus blandientes incor-
ruptus 3 with the force of an adj. in hilis.

5. corporis gaudiis] Cicero, de Fc'n. ii. 4, restricts qau-
dium to mental pleasures, while voluptas, he says, may be
used either of mind or body. But as Epicurus affirmed, that
‚even the pleasures of the body were really resemble to mental
pemeptions, he allows that, in this sense, the body can be said
yauclere. Taso. V. 33.

1 t6. Artes animi] “Occupations which exercise the intel-
ec ,⁷⁷

CHAPTER ΙΙΙ.
1. Ex his] ‘⁶ Of these occupations.’'

2. Magistratus et imperia] Those who held mayistratus,
scil. dictators, consuls, praetors, eensors, dac„ elected by the
people at the comitia centuriata, had civil imperium of various
kinds in the city, and were said in imperio esse; when any
such officers went into the provinces, they exereised military
imperium through a lex curiata, and were then said cum im-
perto esse.

3. Honos] In its technical sense, “ civie distinction‚’' i. q.
ἷζοηονεε. Liv. xlii. 22, quo die novi magistratus inituri erant
onorem.

4. Is fuit] Scil. is honos. So Kritz reads, on the author-
ity of several MSS. The more common reading is jus or vis,
neither of which words gives a satisfactory sense.

5. Utique] So the MSS. generally, but omitted in most
editions: the word implies forsooth, or, as they think.

6. Patriam aut parentes] Comp. Catil. 6, patriam pa-
rentesque armis tegere. J uywr. 87, armis patriam parentesque
tegi, where parentes can only mean parents, or generally rela-
tives. But parentes is used sometimes for subject-5, i. q. obedi-
entes: as JugJ. 102, parentes abunde habemus, amicorum nun-
quam satis fuit. Here the disjunctive aut marks an opposition
between the two objects‚ and parentes may best be construed
‘⁶ subjects.⁷’

7. Importunum est] “ Is inconvenient, injuriousff’
However much the usui-per may employ his power to reform
abuses, stin the revolution by which he has risen will engender
worse evils. These remarks are supposed to point to the usur-
pation of Caesar, or of the second Triumvirate.
