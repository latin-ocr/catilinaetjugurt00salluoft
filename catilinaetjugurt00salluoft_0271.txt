4. contemnere] “ Express their contempt for.” So Cic.
pro Mur. 7, contempsisti Murenae genua extulisti tuum.

5. Bonum et aequum] Bonum, that which is good in
itself ε aequum, that which may be required of one.

6. Aemilius Scaurus] There were several families belong-
ing to the Aemilian gens, distinguished by the sui-names Lepi-
dus, Paullus, Scaurus, dxc. Scaurus signifies a person with
crooked or weak ancles. Hor. Sat. i. 3. 47, scaurum pravis
fultum male talis. The greatest man of this family was the
M. Scaurus here mentioned. He was consul 13.c. 115; tn·-
umphed over the Ligures, and made the Aemilian KVay from
Pisae to Lunae and thence to Dertona. Strab. v. He was
consul B.e. 107, censor, and afterwards princeps senatus. He
was a staunch champion of the senate; nevertheless he was
accused by Varius, a tribune of the people, of exciting the
Italians to revolt, B.c. 90. Scaurus proudly demanded of the
people whether they would take the word of Varirm, a Spani-
ard, or of Scaurus, the prince of the senate3 and this appeal
was answered with acclamations. Cicero extols the character
of Scaurus as a champion of the nobility. For the same rea-
son probably Sallust seeks to depreciate him.

7. Polluta] “ Shameless;'’ “detestable.’' J ιιῃ. 53, indig-
nus honore et quasi pollutus

CHAPTER XVI.
1. Pretium aut gratiam] ‘⁴ Bribery or infiuence.’'

2. L. opimius] A champion of the optimates, and vehe-
ment opponent of the Agrarian laws of the Gracchi. He was
consul B.c. 121, in which capacity the senate called upon him
to see “ne quid res publica detrimenti eaperet.” This decr-ee
was called Senatus-consultum ultimum, and was interpreted
hythe nobles as investing the consul with plenary authority
over the lives of the citizens. ν Accordingly Opimius caused
C. Gracchus, and his colleague in the tribunate, Fulvius Flac-
cuS, to be seized, as public enemies, and put to death. The
plebs denied the right to put any citizen to death except by a
vote of the people. Opimius was eventually condemned by a
popular vote for taking bribes of Jugurtha‚ and driven into
banishment. Cicero extols him as the saviour of the common-
wealth.

3. Victoriam] Opimius followed up the slaughter of Grac-
chus by the massacre of three thousand of his partizans in the
city. Plut. G. Gracch. Victoriam exercere is to exercise the
rights of victory. So in Catil. 38.
