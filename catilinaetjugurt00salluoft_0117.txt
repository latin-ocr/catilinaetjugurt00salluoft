5. Domi militiaeque] Ordinarily the consul exercised no
military imperium within the city, but only in the camp: on
these occasions the imperium was added to the judicium or jus
juris dicendi, within the city alm, i. e. the city was put under
military law.

6. Nullius] There is MS. authority for the genitive, and
the common reading, nulli, can hardly stand, whether it be
connected with rerum, or consuli. The meaning of the passage
is: “except in the case of the senate using its prerogative to
issue its ultimate decree, the consul has no jus of any kind,
either separate or conjoined‚ but what he derives from the
appointment of the people.‘' The phrase populi jussus is
equivocal. Properly it means the decree of the curies, by which⁷
in early times, the imperium was conferred upon the kings, and
after the establishment of the republic, upon the consuls,
posterior to their electiori by the centuries. In process of time
this became a mere form. But the phrase may be used loosely
for the electiori itself‚ by which the consul became virtually
invested with the jus juris dicendi, and jus imperandi beyond
the walls. Sallust means perhaps to reserve to the people the
right of extending this jus in extreme cases to paramount
authority within the city3 'which however they never ventured
to claim, though they strongly objected to its exercise by the
senate.

CHAPTER XXX.

1. Arma portari] Gaius distinguishes ferre, portare and
ssyer-e: Ferri proprie dicimus quae quis suo corpore bajulat,
portari ea quae quis in jumento secum ducit, agi ea quae
animalia sunt: portare is also emphatic 01· poetic forserre. So
ferre, vehere, portare are used with some distinction by Statius,
Theb. viii. 315, in an address to the Earth which had swallowed
up Amphiaraus: ,

domos Atlanta supernas
Ferre laborantem nullo vehis ipsa labore:
Nos tantum portare negas? 1108, Diva, gravaris?

scil. “to bear‚” “to carry,'' “to supp0rt.‘'

2. senati decreto] This ancient form of the genitive is
sanctioned by Nonius, viii. 103 and Donatus on Terence Andr.
